In a career spanning more than four decades, he wrote poetry, fiction, plays, lectures, book reviews, editorials, and magazine sketches in addition to fiction. As he moved from California to the eastern U.S. to Europe, he incorporated new subjects and characters into his stories, but his Gold Rush tales have been most often reprinted, adapted, and admired.  - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/19/items/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/little_red_riding_hood_1502.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>What the Wolf Really Said to Little Red Riding Hood</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/19/items/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox/little_red_riding_hood_1502.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d3a886;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/whatthewolfreallysaid_150_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
