Gareth Dalmain falls in love with the Honorable Jane Champion. She loves him back, but does not trust his love, as is known to be a great lover of beauty, and she - alas - is very plain. Just as she decides to trust him, she receives news that he has been blinded in a hunting accident. She wants to go visit him, but he will not receive her, as he wants only her love - not her pity. With the help of their mutual friend and doctor, she gets the position as his nurse under a presumed name, and thereby gets to know the 'new' Gareth. </br>(Summary by Maria Elmvang)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/rosary_librivox/Rosary_1107.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Rosary</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/rosary_librivox/Rosary_1107.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#2a0b10;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/rosary_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
