Therefore you will find the tales full of giants and dwarfs,—spirits of the cold mountains and dark caverns.
You will find the hero to be Thor, with his thunderbolt hammer, who dwells in the happy heaven of Asgard, where All-Father Odin is king, and where Balder the beautiful makes springtime with his smile. In the north countries, winter, cold, and frost are very real and terrible enemies; while spring, sunshine, and warmth are near and dear friends. So the story of the Beginning of Things is a story of cold and heat, of the wicked giants who loved the cold, and of the good Æsir, who basked in pleasant warmth. - Summary by the author</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/inthedaysofgiants_1409_librivox/days_giants_1409.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>In The Days of Giants</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/inthedaysofgiants_1409_librivox/days_giants_1409.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ccbc45;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/inthedaysofgiants_1409_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
