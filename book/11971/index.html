In other Railway Guides, pleasing fancy, poesy and literary beauty, have been throttled at the very threshold of success, by a wild incontinence of facts, figures, asterisks and references to meal stations. For this reason a guide has been built at our own shops and on a new plan. It is the literary piece de resistance of the age in which we live. It will not permit information to creep in and mar the reader's enjoyment of the scenery. It contains no railroad map which is grossly inaccurate. It has no time-table in it which has outlived its uselessness. It does not prohibit passengers from riding on the platform while the cars are in motion. It permits every one to do just as he pleases and rather encourages him in taking that course." - Bill Nye"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/6/items/nye_and_rileys_wit_and_humor_1803_librivox/withumor_1803_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Nye and Riley's Wit and Humor</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/6/items/nye_and_rileys_wit_and_humor_1803_librivox/withumor_1803_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#0f0f0f;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/nye_and_rileys_wit_and_humor_1803_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
