But the two befriended one another, and these nomads fended for themselves until they too became separated in an unfortunate way.  While Neewa searched for his friend, Miki was taken by northern trappers who felt he could be trained to become a good fighting dog, a valuable asset in the north.  What follows is Miki's attempts to flee from his captors and search for his master, and Neewa's search for his canine friend. - Summary by Roger Melin<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/nomadsofthenorth_1402_librivox/nomads_north_1402.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Nomads of the North</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/nomadsofthenorth_1402_librivox/nomads_north_1402.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d9dde8;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/nomadsofthenorth_1402_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
