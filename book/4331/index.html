Though he loves her truly, she has severe misgivings. She goes through with the wedding in spite of this, but refuses to live with her new husband, and cannot be enticed or cajoled to do so. Then on the day the Captain is scheduled to ship out, she receives word that he has been gravely injured and his dying request is to see his wife. She flies to his side... and thus begins an adventure spanning eight years - love, loathing, shipwreck, love lost, and redemption. (Summary by P. Cunningham and Nadine Eckert-Boulet)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/abandoned_1012_librivox/abandoned_1012.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Abandoned</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/abandoned_1012_librivox/abandoned_1012.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#0f403a;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/abandoned_1012_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
