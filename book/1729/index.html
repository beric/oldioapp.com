This proves impossible, and she gives up her fortune to marry for love.Jane Austen referred to Cecilia and other novels in her novel, Northanger Abbey: “'And what are you reading, Miss — ?' 'Oh! It is only a novel!' replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. 'It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda'; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best–chosen language. The title of Austen's Pride and Prejudice may have been inspired by a passage at the end of Cecilia: “remember: if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination.” (Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Karen Merline)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/cecilia_0906_librivox/Cecilia_1204.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Cecilia: Memoirs of an Heiress</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/cecilia_0906_librivox/Cecilia_1204.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/cecilia_0906_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
