Following what could only have been a harrowing and harsh existence in Russia’s infamous prison for political and social prisoners, one would expect Dostoyevsky’s work to have been dark and bitter.  Rather, <i>Uncle’s Dream </i>is a humorous and yet scathing commentary on Russian provincial high-society.<br><br>The story of elderly Prince K. who comes to visit the town of Mordasoff, lorded over by the imperious Maria Alexandrovna, is one of love, hate, deceit and greed.  Standing reluctantly at Maria Alexandrovna’s side is her haughty daughter, Zina, who has few friends of her own. The prince’s companion and distant relative is Paul Mosgliakoff, suitor to Zina.<br><br>Maria Alexandrovna and Zina are the central characters in the charade to lure the senile prince into a marriage of convenience (not for him but for Maria Alexandrovna and Zina).  They, and a host of lesser characters, are brought to life in full color by Dostoyevsky’s masterful wordsmithing.  <i>Uncle’s Dream </i>is a must listen for any fan of not only Dostoyevsky, but of Russian literature and the “goings-on” of the Russian “upper crust.” (Summary by Greg Giordano)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/30/items/unclesdream_1412_librivox/uncles_dream_1412.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Uncle's Dream</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/30/items/unclesdream_1412_librivox/uncles_dream_1412.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/unclesdream_1412_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
