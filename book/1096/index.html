Would you like to learn a little more about the early conservations efforts to protect wild birds? In the Preface to The Bird Study Book, Pearson tells us “This book was written for the consideration of that ever-increasing class of Americans who are interested in acquiring a greater familiarity with the habits and activities of wild birds. Attention is also given to the relation of birds to mankind and the effect of civilisation on the bird-life of the country. ” An avid ornithologist, T. Gilbert Pearson (1873-1943) was a co-founder in 1905 of the National Association of Audubon Societies of which he was first secretary and then president for many years. He was also a pioneer of the conservation movement in the United States, international bird protection and broad nature education for school-aged children. (Audubon Magazine. 42: 370–371. Nov-Dec 1943)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/bird_study_book_librivox/bird_study_book_1107.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Bird Study Book</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/bird_study_book_librivox/bird_study_book_1107.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f3f2f0;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/bird_study_book_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
