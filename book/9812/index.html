The Burning Wheel is his first work, a collection of thirty poems that pay homage in style to poets who wrote in the Romantic or the French symbolist styles. Many of the poems deal with themes of light, darkness, sight, music, art, war, and idealism vs. realism. Though the optimism in his early works waned as he became older, his characteristically optimistic and determined point of view shines through.  - Summary by Mary Kay<br>
The last poem was read collaboratively by ezwa, AlgyPug and Larry Wilson.</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/burning_wheel_1505_librivox/burning_wheel_1505.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Burning Wheel</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/burning_wheel_1505_librivox/burning_wheel_1505.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#120e0d;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/burning_wheel_1505_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
