Such men, when first taken out in the dark, are helpless; they start at every shadow, stumble even on level ground, make a terrible amount of noise, and are generally in such a state of nervous excitement that they are hardly responsible for their actions. Yet these same men, by a short course of careful, individual instruction, can be trained to work together with confidence on the darkest night, and when once they have gained confidence their further instruction is comparatively easy." - Summary by Book Chapter 1"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/night_operations_for_infantry_1708_librivox/nightoperations_1708_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Night Operations For Infantry - Compiled For The Use Of Company Officers (1916)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/night_operations_for_infantry_1708_librivox/nightoperations_1708_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#352b29;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/night_operations_for_infantry_1708_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
