If it is not phenomenally true it may be so substantially. And it is possible that one may see substance in the idiom, so to speak, of the senses. That, I take it, is how the Greeks saw thunder-storms and other huge convulsions; that is how they saw meadow, grove and stream—in terms of their own fair humanity. They saw such natural phenomena as shadows of spiritual conflict or of spiritual calm, and within the appearance apprehended the truth. So it may be that I have done. Some such may be the explanation of all fairy experience. Let it be so. It is a fact, I believe, that there is nothing revealed in this book which will not bear a spiritual, and a moral, interpretation; and I venture to say of some of it that the moral implications involved are exceedingly momentous, and timely too. I need not refer to such matters any further. If they don't speak for themselves they will get no help from a preface. - Summary by Maurice Hewlett"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/33/items/lore_of_proserpine_1608_librivox/lore_proserpine_1608.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Lore of Proserpine</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/33/items/lore_of_proserpine_1608_librivox/lore_proserpine_1608.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#203049;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/lore_of_proserpine_1608_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
