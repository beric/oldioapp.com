<br><br>
Father is away at sea and is expected every day, but when father's ship comes in he is not aboard! With the help of her new friend and neighbour Kitty, she finds out that he was 'took bad' on the other side of the world, who knows when or if he will ever make it back. Meanwhile, Little Meg must take care of Robby and baby. There are better days and worse days. There is the wonderful trip to Temple Gardens and the difficult process of pawning away their best clothes so Meg can buy food and coal. But through everything, Meg's simple childlike faith in God carries her through as each of her prayers are faithfully answered and a happy ending comes in sight!
