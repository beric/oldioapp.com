I feel sure that as long as we look on prayer chiefly as the means of maintaining our own Christian life, we shall not know fully what it is meant to be. But when we learn to regard it as the highest part of the work entrusted to us, the root and strength of all other work, we shall see that there is nothing that we so need to study and practise as the art of praying aright. ... the Father waits to hear every prayer of faith, to give us whatsoever we will, and whatsoever we ask in Jesus’ name. (Andrew Murray, quoted from the Preface of this book)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/5/items/with_christ_in_prayer_0902_librivox/With_Christ_School_Prayer_1203.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>With Christ in the School of Prayer</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/5/items/with_christ_in_prayer_0902_librivox/With_Christ_School_Prayer_1203.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#474a7d;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/with_christ_in_prayer_0902_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
