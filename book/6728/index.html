Josiah Priest, A. M. 5th edition. 

This is a compilation of pro-slavery literature and propaganda that went through numerous editions in the Southern United States before the Civil War. It contains the highly influential book, Slavery, as it Relates to the Negro, or African Race, by Rev Josiah Priest, which was originally published in 1843. This compilation also includes many essays and favorable reviews of Rev Priest’s book from contemporary magazines and newspapers, and written endorsements from national politicians. 

From the preface: ‘The question, “Is slavery, as it exists in the United States, justifiable?” is one which, at least, admits of discussion. If it be in harmony with the immutable principles of truth and justice, and not a “crime against humanity,” and a libel upon our holy religion, let it be so understood and practiced by our honest citizens, whose highest ambition consists in faithfully serving God, and living in obedience to the laws of the country.’ (Summary by JoeD)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/bible_defence_slavery_1208_librivox/bible_defence_slavery_1303.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Bible Defence of Slavery</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/bible_defence_slavery_1208_librivox/bible_defence_slavery_1303.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#7db9af;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/bible_defence_slavery_1208_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
