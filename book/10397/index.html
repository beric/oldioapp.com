He was a Victorian forerunner to Fu Manchu and a sometime literary rival to Sherlock Holmes. He was ruthless in his pursuit of his objectives which range from world domination to cheating death. Irrespective of his villainy and moral turpitude he was bound by a self imposed code of chivalry, He was generous in both victory and defeat which made him a character you want to like rather than hate. <br></br>
