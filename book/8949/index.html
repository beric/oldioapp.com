He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe served as a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena.<br><br>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) wrote his autobiography between the years 1811 and 1833. It covered the years from his youth until he was going to leave Weimar after the completion of his first book, The Sorrows of Young Werther. The Librivox recording of <a href="https://librivox.org/the-autobiography-of-goethe-volume-1-by-johann-wolfgang-von-goethe/">Volume 1</a> includes books one through ten. This second volume includes books ten through thirteen. Johann Goethe was an interesting individual. <br /><br />Here is a sample of Goethe's observations.<br /><br /><i>We (Goethe and Herder) had not lived together long in this manner when he confided to me that he meant to be competitor for the prize which was offered at Berlin, for the best treatise on the origin of language. His work was already nearly completed, and, as he wrote a very neat hand, he could soon communicate to me, in parts, a legible manuscript. I had never reflected on such subjects, for I was yet too deeply involved in the midst of things to have thought about their beginning and end. The question, too, seemed to me in some measure and idle one; for if God had created man as man, language was just as innate in him as walking erect; he must have just as well perceived that he could sing with his throat, and modify the tones in various ways with tongue, palate, and lips, as he must have remarked that he could walk and take hold of things. If man was of divine origin, so was also language itself: and if man, considered in the circle of nature was a natural being, language was likewise natural. These two things, like soul and body, I could never separate.<br /><br />Silberschlag, with a realism crude yet somewhat fantastically devised, had declared himself for the divine origin, that is, that God had played the schoolmaster to the first men. Herder’s treatise went to show that man as man could and must have attained to language by his own powers. I read the treatise with much pleasure, and it was of special aid in strengthening my mind; only I did not stand high enough either in knowledge or thought to form a solid judgment upon it. But one was received just like the other; there was scolding and blaming, whether one agreed with him conditionally or unconditionally. The fat surgeon (Lobstein) had less patience than I; he humorously declined the communication of this prize-essay, and affirmed that he was not prepared to meditate on such abstract topics. He urged us in preference to a game of ombre, which we commonly played together in the evening. </i>P. 349-350 <br />(Wikipedia and Craig Campbell)<br />"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/19/items/autobiographyofgoethevol2_1411_librivox/the_autobiography_of_goethe_volume_2_1411.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Autobiography of Goethe Volume 2</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/19/items/autobiographyofgoethevol2_1411_librivox/the_autobiography_of_goethe_volume_2_1411.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#980e59;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/autobiographyofgoethevol2_1411_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
