With chagrin he saw that Lao Tzu's teaching had never obtained any firm hold on the masses, still less on the rulers of China, whereas the star of Confucius was unmistakably in the ascendant. Within his own recollection the propagation of Confucian ethics had received a powerful impetus from Mencius, the second of China's orthodox sages. Now Chuang Tzu was imbued to the core with the principles of pure Taoism, as handed down by Lao Tzu. He might more fitly be dubbed "the Tao-saturated man" than Spinoza "the God-intoxicated." Tao in its various phases pervaded his inmost being and was reflected in all his thought. He was therefore eminently qualified to revive his Master's ringing protest against the materialistic tendencies of the time. - Summary by Lionel Giles"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/download/musings_of_a_chinese_mystic_1702_librivox/chinesemystic_1702.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Musings of a Chinese Mystic: Selections from the Philosophy of Chuang Tzu</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/download/musings_of_a_chinese_mystic_1702_librivox/chinesemystic_1702.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/musings_of_a_chinese_mystic_1702_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
