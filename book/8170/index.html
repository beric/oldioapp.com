The story opens just before the festival of Hinamatsuri on the third day of the third month, which was set apart as the big birthday of all little girls born in the lovely island, and was celebrated by the Festival of Dolls, which  is celebrated on March 3rd throughout Japan for the well being of young girls, praying for their prosperous health. Isn’t it touching? Here is this country (Japan) who graciously honors a girl child through an ancient festival for their safety expunging the bad spirits from the dolls. 

Yuki San is the young daughter of an old Japanese couple. She's spoiled, sassy, and (in my opinion) quite naughty. The couple tried for many, many years to have a baby and finally Yuki was born. In their eyes she can do no wrong. She is their blessing and will care for them in their final years of life. One day Yuki decides to drown her kitten by throwing it into a gutter that leads to the ocean. Her plan is interrupted by an American teen, Richard Merrit but that's all I'm going to say. You will need to listen to this wonderful tale to find out the surprising stuff that happens to them both. Oh, there is a pre arranged marriage involved here.
