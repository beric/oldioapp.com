Porter" /><meta name="og:description" content=""What a joy! How exciting! Margret Kendall returned home, to her loving and equally beloved mother's arms after 4 years in the slums of New York City- where she endured unimaginable hardships. This hardship made the naturally brilliant nine-years-old strong, resourceful, and full of questions which her mother finds it hard to answer. But this is not the end of the problems she would have to face. Those will include her mother's intended marriage, her need to get along with her stepfather's people, and her ever present worry about her poor friends from New York who were there for her in her darkest moments. This book is ful of twists and turns, but you can hang on to the sub-title "How Margaret Solved Her Problems", and feel more of it's magic. You may think this is a dark book. Yes, it has it's dark parts. But it is also humorous, beautifully written and uplifting.Note that the prequel to this book, Cross Currents, is also available as an audiobook from the LibriVox catalog (Summary by Stav Nisser) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/turnofthetide_1211_librivox/turn_tide_1212.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Turn Of The Tide</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/turnofthetide_1211_librivox/turn_tide_1212.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#a9a2aa;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/turnofthetide_1211_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
