The incidents they relate occurred before the entrance of the United States into World War I as a combatant. “These letters, according to ordinary ethics in such matters, should not, perhaps, be published. They were merely intended as tributes of friendship and remembrance. Casually written — in pencil often — at moments between duties, with no thought of their being destined to any further purpose than that distance and absence might count a little less through the pictures they would give of a day's work far away.” - Summary by Book Preface and David Wales"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_1703.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>With The American Ambulance Field Service In France; Personal Letters Of A Driver At The Front</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/download/americanambulance_1703_librivox/americanambulance_1703.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/americanambulance_1703_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
