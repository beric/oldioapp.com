In the beginnings of Australian poetry the names of two other men stand with his—Adam Lindsay Gordon, of English parentage and education, and Charles Harpur, born in Australia a generation earlier than Kendall. Harpur's work, though lacking vitality, shows fitful gleams of poetic fire suggestive of greater achievement had the circumstances of his life been more favourable. Kendall, whose lot was scarcely more fortunate, is a true singer; his songs remain, and are likely long to remain, attractive to poetry lovers.  - Summary by From the Introduction"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/3/items/poems_and_songs_1701_librivox/poems_songs_1701.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Poems and Songs</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/3/items/poems_and_songs_1701_librivox/poems_songs_1701.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/poems_and_songs_1701_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
