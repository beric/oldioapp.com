Her effort to elevate housework and cooking to a regulated and even scientific business, for the relief of homemakers, is a depiction of the late 19th century movement to promote Domestic Science, or Home Economics, as a means of providing more healthful home life, as well as career paths for women.Diantha's business prospers as she shows her excellent gifts of administration, organization and homemaking. She grows an empire, and brings happiness and wholesomeness to every area of endeavor which she carefully attempts.The improvements in women's opportunities have not been available very long, indeed.This is a good reminder."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/diantha_0903_librivox/What_Diantha_Did_1203.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>What Diantha Did</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/diantha_0903_librivox/What_Diantha_Did_1203.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#808147;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/diantha_0903_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
