He was a reputed scholar, philosopher and Shafi'i jurist who was a professor of theology at the Nizamiyya College of Baghdad.  At the peak of his fame, he was gripped by an internal schism between his beliefs and his inner self.  He gave up his position lead a life of seclusion and personal mystical transformation. During this time of solitude and contemplation he authored a number of seminal works reconciling the outward practices of Islam with a deep inner spirituality.  The Confessions of al-Ghazali (Munkidh min al-Dalal, literally Deliverance from Error), is an intellectual autobiography on al-Ghazali's transformation.  In this work he catalogs  the various sects and schools of thought he encountered on his search for the divine truth. - Summary by Zishan Sheikh"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/18/items/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessions_al_ghazali_1610.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Confessions of al-Ghazali</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/18/items/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox/confessions_al_ghazali_1610.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e9e18c;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/confessionsalghazali_1610_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
