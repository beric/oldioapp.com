He is best known for his catechetical trilogy: The Endowments of Man, The Groundwork of the Christian Virtues, and Christian Patience, published in the 1880s. The Endowments of Man is presented in fourteen lectures, adapted from lectures originally delivered to clerics in Olton, England, at St. Bernard's Seminary, which Bishop Ullathorne founded in 1873. In these lectures, Ullathorne lays a foundation for the practice of the Christian virtues. Copiously citing Sacred Scripture and the writings of Fathers and Doctors of the Church, he presents sound theological doctrines and philosophical principles precisely and thoroughly as he traces the history of man from his creation and origin in God, to his tragic fall, to his restoration and regeneration in Jesus Christ, and finally to his glorious end in beatific union with God.
