His illustrations defined a whole genre which influenced the field for many years.  He was also involved in various socialist causes and leant his artistic talent to many left-leaning publications.  Some of the sentiments can be found reflected in this volume of his own poetry.  The first section contains poems published for the first time, while the second section contains many verses that appeared in other publications and books.  The verses are illustrated with black and white engravings of his art, of course.  The publication page contains this note, “ This Edition on Large Paper is limited to Sixty-five copies for England and Thirty-five for America. This copy is No. 45 of the English Edition.” - Summary by Larry Wilson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/34/items/renascenceabookofverse_1707_librivox/renascenceverse_1707_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Renascence: A Book of Verse</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/34/items/renascenceabookofverse_1707_librivox/renascenceverse_1707_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fcf4e0;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/renascenceabookofverse_1707_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
