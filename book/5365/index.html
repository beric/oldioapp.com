In this funny sequel to Three Men in a Boat J., George, and Harris are out of the boat and on the land riding their bikes. Their lives are too stressful and they need a break from the daily mundane, so they put their heads together and come up with a brilliant idea they decide to travel through the Black Forest of Germany on a bicycling tour. Since two of our friends are now married it seems they will also have to convince their wives that this is a good idea without getting each other into trouble! Meant to be a traveling book, but of course is anything but, let's go along on their journey and see for ourselves what kind of antics and fun our three old friends get caught up in. This book was published eleven years after the original "Three Men in a Boat".
