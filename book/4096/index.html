Isabel Ostrander, who also wrote under the pseudonyms Christopher B. Booth, Robert Orr Chipperfield, David Fox, and Douglas Grant, was a prolific author of early American crime fiction.  In <i>The Crevice</i> she collaborated with coauthor, William J. Burns, who served for three years as director of the Bureau of Investigation (a predecessor of the FBI)and was also famous for his exploits as a private detective.  His cases served as material for the “true” crime stories he later wrote and published in detective magazines in the early 20th century.  (summary by J. M. Smallheer)</p>
