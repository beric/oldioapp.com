He states that he started writing it on about May 28, 1876 and had finished it by August 3.The book was edited by Charles Darwin's son Francis Darwin, who removed several passages about Darwin's critical views of God and Christianity (see Charles Darwin's views on religion). It was published in London by John Murray as part of The life and letters of Charles Darwin, including an autobiographical chapter.The omitted passages were later restored by Darwin's granddaughter Nora Barlow in a 1958 edition to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the publication of The Origin. This edition was published in London by Collins under the title of The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809-1882. With the original omissions restored. Edited and with appendix and notes by his granddaughter Nora Barlow.The original is in the public domain as its copyright has expired, but the later version remains under copyright.(Summary by Wikipedia)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/autobiography_charles_darwin_am_librivox/auto_darwin_1204.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Autobiography of Charles Darwin</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/autobiography_charles_darwin_am_librivox/auto_darwin_1204.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d3d3d3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/autobiography_charles_darwin_am_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
