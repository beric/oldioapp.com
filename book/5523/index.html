It is the poet who sees the vast scale of human struggle with nature or the things she will withhold unless they are forced from her by man's tireless toil and mighty mechanism, and in the vision he knows a battle-joy as distinctive of this Son of the Middle Border as his fidelity to the sordid and squalid details of the campaign, or his exultation of the beauty of the West which he has so passionately hated and finally so passionately loves. As you read the story of his life you realize it the memorial of a generation, of a whole order of American experience; as you review it you perceive it an epic of such mood and make as has not been imagined before.(Introduction by William Dean Howells, New York Times review, August 26, 1917)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/35/items/sonmiddleborder_1303_librivox/son_middle_border_1304.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Son of the Middle Border</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/35/items/sonmiddleborder_1303_librivox/son_middle_border_1304.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#cdcdef;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/sonmiddleborder_1303_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
