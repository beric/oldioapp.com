Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known." In 1907, at the age of 42, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date. He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/8/items/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/white_mans_burden_1607.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>White Man's Burden</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/8/items/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox/white_mans_burden_1607.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#29389d;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/white_mans_burden_1607.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
