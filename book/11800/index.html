He therefore leaves Boston in order to teach at a school in a village in the area. One of his students is Elsie Venner, a seventeen year-old girl, who is avoided by her peers and keeps apart. Somehow, Elsie exerts a great fascination on Langdon, as there is something distinctly different about her with her strangeness and quick temper. <br></br><i>Elsie Venner</i> is one of Oliver Wendell Holmes' "medicated novels", in which he explores a medical condition of a character. Holmes was teaching at Harvard Medical School when this book was published, and he chose to let a professor of medicine narrate the story. <i>Elsie Venner</i> is notable for its strong Boston local colour, being at the same time the book in which Holmes coined the term "Boston Brahmin".  - Summary by Carolin"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/25/items/elsie_venner_1801_librivox/elsievenner_1802_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Elsie Venner</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/25/items/elsie_venner_1801_librivox/elsievenner_1802_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#0c0c0a;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/elsie_venner_1801_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
