C. Simmons, a Canadian soldier captured by the German Army during the early days of World War I. We read of his sixteen months of imprisonment, his encounters with other captured troops of the other Allied armies and his observations of the nature of his captors and their countrymen. Most compellingly we read of his escape from POW camp, his recapture and punishment, and then the capture and punishment following his second escape attempt, climaxing in his third escape attempt and daring travel through enemy territory against all odds. In McClung's words, "Private Simmons is a close and accurate observer who sees clearly and talks well. He tells a straightforward, unadorned tale, every sentence of which is true, and convincing." (Summary by the narrator) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/threetimesandout_1412_librivox/three_times_1412.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Three Times and Out</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/threetimesandout_1412_librivox/three_times_1412.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#1c1c1a;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/threetimesandout_1412_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
