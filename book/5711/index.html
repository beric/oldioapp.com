Spurgeon" /><meta name="og:description" content="Charles Haddon (C.H.) Spurgeon (19 June 1834 – 31 January 1892) was a British Particular Baptist preacher and is still known today as the "Prince of Preachers". He was a strong figure in the Reformed Baptist tradition, defending the Church in agreement with the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith understanding, and opposing the liberal and pragmatic theological tendencies in the Church of his day. In his lifetime, Spurgeon preached to around 10 million people, often up to ten times each week at different places.<br><br>

In this series of devotionals, he challenges each of us to examine our own heart to make sure our faith is solidly grounded, to count the cost, and to experience the promise of grace. “It would be very difficult to say how far a man may go in religion, and yet die in his sins; how much he may look like an heir of heaven, and yet be a child of wrath. Many unconverted men have a belief which is similar to faith, and yet it is not true faith. The life of God within the soul creates an infinite difference between the man who has it and the man who has it not; and the point is, to make sure that we have this life. I desire to help my reader in the business of self-examination. I would have him go further than examination, and attain to such abundance of grace that his holy and happy state shall become a witness to himself. No man can lose by honestly searching his own heart.” (Summary by WYSIWYG, MaryAnn and Charles Spurgeon)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/18/items/according_promise_1110_librivox/according_to_promise_1110.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>According to Promise, or The Lord’s Method of Dealing with His Chosen People</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/18/items/according_promise_1110_librivox/according_to_promise_1110.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#512932;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/according_promise_1110_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
