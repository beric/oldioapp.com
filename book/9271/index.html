He is known as one of Italy's "fathers of the fatherland". Garibaldi was a central figure in the Italian Risorgimento (Resurrection), and led the famous Expedition of the Thousand on  behalf and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II. The volunteers under his command wore red shirts as their uniform and became known in the popular stories as, "The Red Shirts."He gained his military expertise from his experiences in Brazil, Uruguay as well as Europe. Because of his international notoriety the United States and the UK helped in his cause, both financially and militarily. Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and George Sand, intellectuals of the time, greatly admired him.  - Summary by kirk202NOTE: There in no Appendix I."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/garibaldi_making_italy_1501_librivox/garibaldi_1501.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Garibaldi and the Making of Italy</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/garibaldi_making_italy_1501_librivox/garibaldi_1501.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fbe9d3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/garibaldi_making_italy_1501_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
