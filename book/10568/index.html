He happily volunteered to camp out overnight in houses known to be haunted, and he made a concerted effort to discover any unhappy events that had, perhaps, led a ghost to inhabit.

This, then, is a collection of his juiciest remembrances of running down ghosts in Europe and America, both in peace and in the horrors of World War.
