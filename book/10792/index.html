She describes this as the final installment of his series of fairy stories and includes some of those stories he had not included in other collections. In the preface, she pays tribute to her husband, saying he liked old things more than new, he loved all beasts' because they were beasts', fairies, cricket and dancing. He longed to visit far away places, but hated to travel. But most of all he befriended children wherever he went and they shared stories with him. Only his own children mocked him. - Summary by Lynne Thompson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/strangestorybook_1610_librivox/strange_story_book_1610.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Strange Story Book</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/strangestorybook_1610_librivox/strange_story_book_1610.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#c80c12;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/strangestorybook_1610_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
