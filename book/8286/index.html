Railing against Industrialization’s dehumanization, he preached a return to a simple life in harmony with Nature.  Towards Democracy reads like Beat poetry—wild flowing word associations, moments of insight so clear they hurt, interspersed with pure rant!   Included is an essay Carpenter wrote in 1894 explaining his intent and feelings in writing Towards Democracy.  - Summary by Sue Anderson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_1312.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Towards Democracy</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/towards_democracy_sa_librivox/towardsdemocracy_1312.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#300000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/towards_democracy_sa_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
