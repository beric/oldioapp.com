He moved to London in 1894 and became most well-known for his Dr.Nikola mysteries. This book is the first in a series of five and introduces the good doctor himself. Dr Nikola Is a criminal mastermind with an occult twist and like much fiction of that era this book and the following are more about how others fall under his spell and into his web. Here we have an adventure and love story that sweeps us from Australia, the South Seas, the Middle East and rural Hampshire with our lovestruck hero constantly battling against Dr Nikola and his cohorts. The sense of mystery and the exotic settings are exceptionally well portrayed and give the book a nostalgic appeal for the days of imperialists and hardened empire builders. - Summary by Peter Keeble"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/5/items/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bid_fortune_1511.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Bid For Fortune; Or, Dr Nikola's Vendetta</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/5/items/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox/bid_fortune_1511.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/a_bid_for_fortune_1511_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
