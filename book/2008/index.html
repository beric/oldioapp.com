There stood an enormous bird, with a head like an eagle, a neck like a swan, and a scarlet crest. The most astonishing thing was that the bird had an open book on the ground and was reading from it!<br /><br />This was David's first sight of the fabulous Phoenix and the beginning of a pleasant and profitable partnership. The Phoenix found a great deal lacking in David's education -- he flunked questions like "How do you tell a true from a false Unicorn?" -- and undertook to supplement it with a practical education, an education that would be a preparation for Life. The education had to be combined with offensive and defensive measures against a Scientist who was bent on capturing the Phoenix, but the two projects together involved exciting and hilarious adventures for boy and bird.<br /><br />A wonderful read-aloud book, adventurous and very funny, with much of the magic as well as the humor of the fantastic.  (Summary from the front flap of the dust jacket.)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/davidandphoenix_0902_librivox/David_and_the_Phoenix_1005.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>David and the Phoenix</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/davidandphoenix_0902_librivox/David_and_the_Phoenix_1005.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#3b6679;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/davidandphoenix_0902_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
