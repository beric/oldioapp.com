Porter" /><meta name="og:description" content="Cross Currents: The Story of Margaret, to give it its full title, is delightful story about a little girl’s resilience and a mother’s unwavering love, from the beloved author of Pollyanna. Margaret Kendall (the Margaret of the story) has known nothing but love, wealth and privilege for the first five years of her life. An accident during a visit with her mother to New York City leaves little Margaret alone and fending for herself. While her mother searches desperately for her, Margaret has to do the best she can by herself. The book also also provides a glimpse into the everyday life of working children at the turn of the last century. Not always a pretty picture. Cross Currents is followed by The Turn of the Tide, which follows Margaret as she leaves New York and grows older.
