He became apprenticed to his father who was an engraver and invented a special ruling machine for engravers but went on to emulate his mother who was a children's writer.  His books include favourites like Harry's Holliday or the Doings of One Who had Nothing to Do and The Little Historians.  This book "Aesop in Rhyme" published in 1820, contains 58 of Aesop's Fables which he has retold in verse as well as 13 original fables of his own.  Each is illustrated with an engraving which though uncredited he probably drew himself. He died in 1853.
