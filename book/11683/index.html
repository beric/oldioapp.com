It includes short poems and brief descriptions of birds, animals and other natural subjects with accompanying color plates. The magazine was published from 1897-1907 under the various titles, "Birds," "Birds and all Nature," "Nature and Art" and "Birds and Nature." This issue is the first published under the title "Nature and Art."<br><br>

“Birds and All Nature” was established January 1897 as “Birds” and has been a magazine of NATURE AND ART since its beginning; therefore it has been urged by many of our subscribers and friends that the name be changed to better express the nature of its contents.  Hence the change to “NATURE AND ART.”
