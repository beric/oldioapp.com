But there are certain of his stories that go with especial directness to a boy’s heart and sympathies and make for him quite unforgettable literature. A few of these were made some years ago into a volume, “Stories for Boys,” and found a large and enthusiastic special public in addition to Davis’s general readers; and the present collection from stories more recently published is issued with the same motive. This book takes its title from “The Boy Scout,” the first of its tales; and it includes “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” “Blood Will Tell,” the immortal “Gallegher,” and “The Bar Sinister,” Davis’s famous dog story. It is a fresh volume added to what Augustus Thomas calls “safe stuff to give to a young fellow who likes to take off his hat and dilate his nostrils and feel the wind in his face.” (Summary by Publisher's Note in book)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boy_scout_1206.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Boy Scout And Other Stories For Boys</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/boy_scout_dw_librivox/boy_scout_1206.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/boy_scout_dw_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
