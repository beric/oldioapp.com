She defined it in her preface to "Sword Blades and Poppy Seed"; in the North American Review for January, 1917; in the closing chapter of "Tendencies in Modern American Poetry"; and also in the Dial (January 17, 1918), as: "The definition of Vers libre is: a verse-formal based upon cadence. To understand vers libre, one must abandon all desire to find in it the even rhythm of metrical feet. One must allow the lines to flow as they will when read aloud by an intelligent reader. Or, to put it another way, unrhymed cadence is "built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system. Free verse within its own law of cadence has no absolute rules; it would not be 'free' if it had."  - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_amy_lowell_1602.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Gift</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox/gift_amy_lowell_1602.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ceb6ac;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/a_gift_1602.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
