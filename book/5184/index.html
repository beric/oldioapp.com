Imagine that this couple has become “embarrassed financially” by “imprudent speculations,” and that they are discussing what to do. They decide to buy a wagon and three yoke of unbroken oxen and head overland to California.<br><br>"We were two such precious dunces,” writes Lavinia Honeyman Porter in her autobiographical account of their journey across the plains. “In a short time the six oxen were bought, driven to our home and turned loose in our barnyard--wild brutes, as handy as with their heels as with their horns. Not one of us was brave enough to venture into the corral with them and we soon concluded we had six white elephants on our hands.” From there on in, Lavinia's adventures get worse—and then better.  For those who enjoy true stories of pioneering days and happy endings, this is an enjoyable read.<br>(Introduction by Sue Anderson)<br/><br/>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/ox_team_california_sa_librivox/By_Ox_Team_to_California_1103.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>By Ox Team to California - A Narrative of Crossing the Plains in 1860</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/ox_team_california_sa_librivox/By_Ox_Team_to_California_1103.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f1e5cb;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/ox_team_california_sa_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
