Although Andrew Lang did not collect the stories himself from the oral tradition, the extent of his sources, who had collected them originally (with the notable exception of Madame d'Aulnoy), made them an immensely influential collection, especially as he used foreign-language sources, giving many of these tales their first appearance in English. As acknowledged in the prefaces, although Lang himself made most of the selections, his wife and other translators did a large portion of the translating and telling of the actual stories.<br><br>"The irony of Lang's life and work is that although he wrote for a profession—literary criticism; fiction; poems; books and articles on anthropology, mythology, history, and travel ... he is best recognized for the works he did not write."[1]

Many of the books were illustrated by Henry J. Ford, Lancelot Speed, and G. P. Jacomb-Hood also contributed some illustrations. </p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox/green_fairy_book_1208.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Green Fairy Book</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox/green_fairy_book_1208.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#193e36;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/green_fairy_book_1012_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
