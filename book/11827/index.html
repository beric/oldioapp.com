Stane, a former convict in England, has established a lonely life as a trapper in the north woods. While visiting a trading post, he encounters Ainley whom he had known when they were both students. Stane had been wrongly convicted of a crime and had always thought Ainley was somehow connected with his conviction. Also at the post were two women, Miskodeed, a beautiful Indian maiden, and Helen, the niece of a high company official. Helen disappears. Ainley searches for her. She is rescued by Stane. Follow the adventures of these characters in an riveting tale set in the snowy North woods.
