Daddy Jack, an old "Africa man" visiting from down-state; Sis Tempy, the strong chief of the mansion's servants; and Tildy, a young and pretty servant-girl - all found their way to Uncle Remus' rude cabin when their duties or interests permitted, to sit around the hearth and hear the wonderful tales of the animals, and foremost among them, Brer Rabbit and Brer Fox.<br></br>It turned out that some of the tales had different ways of telling, and the visitors took their turns at being the story-teller. Always one or more clever animals humbled or hornswoggled others among their community with flattery, wide-eyed mystery, or outright fraud.<br></br>After the success of Harris' "Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings" ( http://librivox.org/uncle-remus-by-joel-chandler-harris/ ), he went on to write eight more books compiling the tales he himself had heard on the plantation in his young days. This is the first of those sequels.</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/nights_with_uncle_remus_ms_librivox/nights_with_uncle_remus_1106.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Nights With Uncle Remus</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/nights_with_uncle_remus_ms_librivox/nights_with_uncle_remus_1106.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fefefe;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/nights_with_uncle_remus_ms_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
