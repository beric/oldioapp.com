But let a light be introduced, and immediately all confusion disappears. Every object is seen, and there is no danger of being hurt. To the majority, life is such a dark room, and their frequent hurts—their disappointments, perplexities, sorrows and pains—are caused by sudden contact with principles which they do not see, and are therefore not prepared to deal with. But when the light of wisdom is introduced into the darkened understanding, confusion vanishes, difficulties are dissolved, all things are seen in their true place and proportion, and henceforth the man walks open-eyed and unhurt, in the clear light of wise comprehension.  - Summary by James Allen"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/22/items/lightonlifesdifficulties_1404_librivox/light_lifes_difficulties_1404.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Light on Life’s Difficulties</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/22/items/lightonlifesdifficulties_1404_librivox/light_lifes_difficulties_1404.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#dc7e38;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/lightonlifesdifficulties_1404_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
