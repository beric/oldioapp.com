A young lady called Sally Nightingale feels responsible, and brings him home to her mother. But in a strange twist of fate it transpires that her mother is the man's ex wife, whom he left twenty years earlier in unhappy circumstances. The old attraction is there, but what will happen if and when his memory returns? A highly melodramatic plot, but with a deft comic touch, a host of vibrant characters, and a large dash of romance.

De Morgan is best known as a designer. One of the pioneers of the arts and crafts movement, he was a lifelong friend of William Morris and designed tiles and ceramics for Morris & Co for many years. But during his lifetime he also found considerable success as a writer. Over a century later his novels provide the reader with a picture - as intricately designed and lavishly colourful as his ceramics - of an England which, in a few short years after their publication, was to be changed forever by the First World War. With a style that at times is reminiscent of Thackeray or Dickens, De Morgan is a writer with a distinctive voice, wry wit, and - if 'Somehow Good' is any indicator - a truly sentimental heart.
