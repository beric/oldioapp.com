Willson" /><meta name="og:description" content="This book follows the three amazing stories of Adoniram Judson's wives, Ann, Sarah, and Emily. Each wife went through incredible hardships, but each hardship only proved to make them strong women of faith, who despite all difficulties and illnesses, selflessly gave their strength to the sick and needy. Ann Judson followed Her husband from prison to prison, bribing guards so that she could see him and make his condition a little better. They sacrificed lives of ease, with loving families and friends for lives of hardship, sickness and sorrow, but what a joy and peace came with it only God can provide, but anyone can know! None of them regretted going to Burma as a missionaries wife, they would not have turned back if they could and their letters and writing are enough to encourage those in the very worst of circumstances. This book will leave you refreshed, convicted, encouraged and I pray, closer to the Lord, these three women were mightily used of God!
