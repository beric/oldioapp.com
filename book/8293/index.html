LibriVox has three excellent dramatic recordings with all the parts played by different people so if that is more to your taste, please listen to them.   
Little needs to be said about the play itself, a sparkling example of Wilde's amazing ability to poke fun at almost everyone while making you laugh out loud at the witty sayings sprinkled throughout the acts.  As to the plot, if you don't know it already, let me just say that it involves two young English men who fall madly and instantly in love with two young English.women who of course love them back mainly because their name is Earnest.  Unfortunately, that is not their names and there are  many bumps and crashes on the road to the happy wedding bells.  I only hope I have done justice to this jewel of a play.   Please listen and enjoy !     <p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/importanceofbeingearnest_1311_librivox/importanceofbeingearnest2_1311.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Importance of Being Earnest (Version 4)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/importanceofbeingearnest_1311_librivox/importanceofbeingearnest2_1311.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fefefe;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/importanceofbeingearnest_1311_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
