This was the Weekly Poetry project for November 28th, 2010Anne Brontë was a British novelist and poet, the youngest member of the Brontë literary family. She wrote a volume of poetry with her sisters (Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, 1846) and in short succession she wrote two novels. Agnes Grey, based upon her experiences as a governess, was published in 1847. Her second and last novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall appeared in 1848. Anne's life was cut short with her death of pulmonary tuberculosis when she was 29 years old. She published under the androgynous pen name Acton Bell. (summary by Wikipedia)

Please note, at the time of this poetry project, the Gutenburg index was mis-interpreted and this poem was mistakenly attributed to Emily Brontë / Ellis Bell. The recorded LibriVox introductions will reflect this mistake."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/5/items/pastdays_1012_librivox/Past_Days_1210.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Past Days</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/5/items/pastdays_1012_librivox/Past_Days_1210.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#efbe00;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/pastdays_1012_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
