The story revolves around Jimmy not being sure whether or not he shot and killed a Northwest Mounted while he and some friends were out hunting one day. Not exactly a bushman, he needs to head northwest to avoid capture by the officials who are out to find him and bring him to trial. At least that's what he suspects. Survival in the wilderness for one who was raised in British class proves to be a daunting experience, and we learn of the trials he is to be put through while he is on the lam. (Summary by Roger Melin) <br /><br />"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/4/items/northwest_1210_librivox/Northwest_1210.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Northwest!</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/4/items/northwest_1210_librivox/Northwest_1210.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#674810;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/northwest_1210_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
