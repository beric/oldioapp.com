It contains practical directions accompanied by simple and fundamental exercises, first for the freeing of the voice and then for developing it when free."<br /><br />Parts I and II of the book comprise advice on vocal production and techniques, while some chapters in Part III provide detailed guidance on the vocal interpretation of various literary genres, including the essay, various types of poetry, short stories, dramatic monologues and plays. Some chapters comprise mainly examples for practice, and include complete poems and stories.<br /><br />The reader has endeavoured to follow the author's instructions, but makes no guarantee as to her success, especially in the poetic realm.<br /><br />"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/speaking_voice_rg_librivox/speaking_voice_1206.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Speaking Voice</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/speaking_voice_rg_librivox/speaking_voice_1206.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#eff2c7;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/speaking_voice_rg_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
