Influenced by the work of another Australian poet John Farrell, his representation of the bushman as a tough, independent and heroic underdog became the ideal qualities underpinning the national character. His work is often compared to the prose of Henry Lawson, particularly the seminal work, "The Drover's Wife", which presented a considerably less romantic view of the harshness of rural existence of the late 19th century.
(In regard to this poem. When an attorney is called before the Full Court to answer for any alleged misconduct it is not usual to publish his name until he is found guilty; until then the matter appears in the papers as "In re a Gentleman, One of the Attorneys of the Supreme Court," or, more shortly, "In re a Gent., One.") - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/gentleman_1702.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>''In Re a Gentleman, One''</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/download/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox/gentleman_1702.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/in_re_a_gentleman_one_1701.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
