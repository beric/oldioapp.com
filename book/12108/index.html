As Wikipedia notes, Longfellow himself was not entirely satisfied with his work: "However, as Longfellow himself wrote, the poems were 'so mild that even a Slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite for breakfast'. A critic for The Dial agreed, calling it 'the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow's thin books; spirited and polished like its forerunners; but the topic would warrant a deeper tone'. The New England Anti-Slavery Association, however, was satisfied enough with the collection to reprint it for further distribution." Despite these shortcomings, however, this volume is of historical importance and will interest many listeners. - Summary by Carolin"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/poems_on_slavery_1708_librivox/poemsonslavery_1708_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Poems on Slavery</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/poems_on_slavery_1708_librivox/poemsonslavery_1708_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d2d8d6;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/poems_on_slavery_1708_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
