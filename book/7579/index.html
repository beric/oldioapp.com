This is a lesser-known work, often overlooked. These Spiritual Maxims were manuscripts found amongst the aforementioned Letters and also written by Brother Lawrence himself. The Maxims are different from the letters — the careful arrangement adopted suggests matured thought and the inference is not unreasonable that he intended them to sum up his teachings.<br /><br />The reader apologises for the unworthiness of his delivery… the English itself was difficult enough to read and the ancient punctuation had more commas than full stops. My sometimes stilted delivery is caused by me being partially-sighted and having to read everything in short sections.
