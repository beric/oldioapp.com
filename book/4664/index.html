He is best known, of course, for his many attempts on the Matterhorn, and for the loss of four members of his climbing party after the successful first ascent of the peak in July, 1865. Although the Matterhorn stands in ways in the center of his book, there are descriptions of many other ascents as well, in the Alps of France and Italy, as well as those of Switzerland. His book, incidentally, has many of his drawings in it (he was originally an illustrator by profession), and listeners might wish to call up the .pdf file from which it is read, to have the benefit of the illustrations.
