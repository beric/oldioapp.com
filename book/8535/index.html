I have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that I have heard and seen, and, except by way of commentary, nothing that I have merely imagined.<br><br>Many of the tales in this book were told me by one Paddy Flynn, a little bright-eyed old man, who lived in a leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village of Ballisodare. He was a great teller of tales, and unlike our common romancers, knew how to empty heaven, hell, and purgatory, faeryland and earth, to people his stories. He did not live in a shrunken world, but knew of no less ample circumstance than did Homer himself. Perhaps the Gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination.<br><br>Let us go forth, the tellers of tales, and seize whatever prey the heart long for, and have no fear. Everything exists, everything is true, and the earth is only a little dust under our feet. (W. B. Yeats)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/18/items/celtictwilight_1408_librivox/celtic_twilight_1408.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Celtic Twilight</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/18/items/celtictwilight_1408_librivox/celtic_twilight_1408.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#979684;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/celtictwilight_1408_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
