Teasdale's first poem was published in Reedy's Mirror, a local newspaper, in 1907. Her first collection of poems, Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, was published that same year.

Teasdale's second collection, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, was published in 1911.[2] It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter.
Teasdale's third poetry collection, Rivers to the Sea, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times.

In 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection Love Songs. It was "made possible by a special grant from The Poetry Society"; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (inaugurated 1922). - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox/Wine_1603.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Wine</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox/Wine_1603.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#010101;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_wine_1603.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
