Murray's meditations provide a thoughtful guide for believers who desire to develop a deeper understanding of the Lord's Holy Supper. The devotional covers the week before, during, and after the Supper, and each entry is labeled with the day of the week so that readers can manage devotions with ease. Murray first explains how believers can prepare to receive God's blessing during the weeks before the Supper. Murray further encourages believers to be filled with God's love, repent of sinful deeds, and meditate on his grace. During the day of Holy Communion, we are called to pour out our hearts to Christ as he strengthens us through his body and blood, which quenches our thirst and feeds our souls. In the days after communion, Murray tenderly urges us to dwell on the redeeming power of sanctification. Murray's text is an excellent resource for those who desire to grow in their faith through Communion.
