I have several reasons, which shall appear in due course. At present I offer one. 
I oppose Christianity because it is not true.
No honest man will ask for any other reason. But it may be asked why I say that Christianity is not true; and that is a very proper question, which I shall do my best to answer." Thus states the author in one of the first chapters of this book, and subsequently he lays down his apology, drawing his conclusions from numerous books published by believers and unbelievers alike, and, of course, from the bible itself. (Summary by Availle, with a quote from the book.)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/god_and_my_neighbour_1512_librivox/godandmyneighbour_1512.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>God and my Neighbour</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/god_and_my_neighbour_1512_librivox/godandmyneighbour_1512.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/god_and_my_neighbour_1512_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
