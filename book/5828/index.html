(Saturday Review) - although Trollope himself considered it `the best novel I ever wrote! Very much! Quite far away above all others!!!'This tightly constructed and passionate study of enforced marriage in the world of Radical politics and social inequality, records the lifelong attempt of Countess Lovel to justify her claim to her title, and her daughter Anna's legitimacy, after her husband announces that he already has a wife. However, mother and daughter are driven apart when Anna defies her mother's wish that she marry her cousin, heir to her father's title, and falls in love with journeyman tailor and young Radical Daniel Thwaite. The outcome is never in doubt, but Trollope's ambivalence on the question is profound, and the novel both intense and powerful."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/lady_anna_1111_librivox/ladyanna_1202.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Lady Anna</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/lady_anna_1111_librivox/ladyanna_1202.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#878265;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/lady_anna_1111_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
