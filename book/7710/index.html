Indeed, it was the same beautiful morning in which Grandfather Frog had caught so many foolish green flies. Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was smiling his broadest. The Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West Wind were dancing happily here and there over the Green Meadows, looking for some good turn to do for others. The little feathered people to whom Old Mother Nature has given the great blessing of music in their throats were pouring out their sweetest songs. So it seemed as if there was no good reason why Longlegs should feel out of sorts. The fact is the trouble with Longlegs was an empty stomach. Yes, Sir, that is what ailed Longlegs the Blue Heron that sunshiny morning. You know it is hard work to be hungry and happy at the same time. (Summary by Thornton W. Burgess in Chapter 2) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/5/items/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox/grandfatherfrog_1306.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Adventures of Grandfather Frog</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/5/items/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox/grandfatherfrog_1306.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffff00;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/grandfatherfrog_1305_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
