White's books were popular at a time when America was losing its vanishing wilderness. He was a keen observer of the beauties of nature and human nature, yet could render them in a plain-spoken style. Based on his own experience, whether writing camping journals or Westerns, he included pithy and fun details about cabin-building, canoeing, logging, gold-hunting, and guns and fishing and hunting. He also interviewed people who had been involved in the fur trade, the California gold rush and other pioneers which provided him with details that give his novels verisimilitude. He salted in humor and sympathy for colorful characters such as canny Indian guides and "greenhorn" campers who carried too much gear. - Summary by Wikipedia and david wales<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/33/items/blazedtrailstoriesandstoriesofthewildlife_1404_librivox/blazed_trail_stories_1404.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Blazed Trail Stories and Stories Of The Wild Life</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/33/items/blazedtrailstoriesandstoriesofthewildlife_1404_librivox/blazed_trail_stories_1404.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#aeaeae;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/blazedtrailstoriesandstoriesofthewildlife_1404_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
