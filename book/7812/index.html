To meet all this great food need in Europe—and meeting it is an imperative military necessity—we must be very careful and economical in our food use here at home. We must eat less; we must waste nothing; we must equalize the distribution of what food we may retain for ourselves; we must prevent extortion and profiteering which make prices so high that the poor cannot buy the food they actually need; and we must try to produce more food. For all this there is needed a "food education" of all our people. For the purpose of diffusing this information this little book has been prepared under the direction of the Food Administration. By following the suggestions for food conservation herein contained every one can render his country an important war service." (Summary excerpted from the Preface by Herbert Hoover) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/food_guide_for_war_service_at_home_mk_librivox/foodguide_1305.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Food Guide for War Service at Home</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/food_guide_for_war_service_at_home_mk_librivox/foodguide_1305.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/food_guide_for_war_service_at_home_mk_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
