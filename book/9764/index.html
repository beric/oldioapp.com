Tarbell" /><meta name="og:description" content="How were women's roles changing in the 1900's?  Ida Tarbell explores this in a well written, witty and insightful series of essays.  "The object of this little volume is to call attention to a certain distrust, which the author feels in the modern woman, of the significance and dignity of the work laid upon her by Nature and by society. Its ideas are the result of a long, if somewhat desultory, observation of the professional, political, and domestic activities of women in this country and in France. These observations have led to certain definite opinions as to those phases of the woman question most in need of emphasis to-day."  This book contains, as a footnote, a Declaration of Sentiments which begins 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal...'  and continues on.  A wonderful declaration of the equality of the sexes in many things.  This will be a separate section of this project since I think it is excellent in style and sentiment.  - Summary by the introduction and BC"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/6/items/thebusinessofbeingawoman_1603_librivox/businessofbeingawoman_1603.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Business of Being a Woman</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/6/items/thebusinessofbeingawoman_1603_librivox/businessofbeingawoman_1603.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fefefe;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/thebusinessofbeingawoman_1603_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
