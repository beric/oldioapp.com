This was the Weekly Poetry project for December 5th, 2010.Ball wrote his poem "Karawane," which is a German poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning however resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism.Dada or Dadaism is a cultural movement that began in Zürich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1922.[1] The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature—poetry, art manifestoes, art theory—theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Its purpose was to ridicule what its participants considered to be the meaninglessness of the modern world. In addition to being anti-war, dada was also anti-bourgeois and anarchistic in nature.(summary from Wikipedia)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/2/items/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_1204.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Karawane</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/2/items/karawane_1012_librivox/karawane_1204.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#580095;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/karawane_1012_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
