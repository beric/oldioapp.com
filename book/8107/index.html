In 1599, Elizabeth commanded master organ builder Dallam to construct and deliver to the Grand Signieur , as a present intended to garner trade and political advantages for England, a fantastic mechanical organ.  Dallam’s wonder stood 16 feet high and was topped by  a silver  holly bush filled with blackbirds and thrushes that sung and shook their wings.   Dallam kept a diary during his visit to Turkey, which included a sneak look through a grate at the Grand Turk’s concubines in the harem.  “I stood so long looking upon them that (the guide) stamped with his foot to make me give over looking; the which I was very loath to do, for that sight did please me wondrous well.”  Dallam’s ingenuous style and numerous adventures make for a highly enjoyable listen.  - Summary by Sue Anderson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/dallamstravels_1310_librivox/book_dallamstravels_1310.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Dallam's Travels with an Organ to the Grand Signieur, 1599-1600</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/dallamstravels_1310_librivox/book_dallamstravels_1310.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/dallamstravels_1310_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
