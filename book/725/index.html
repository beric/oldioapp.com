Henry" /><meta name="og:description" content="<p>Born in 1862 and died in 1910, O. Henry’s birth name is William Sydney Porter; however, he adopted the pen name O. Henry while in prison. He published 10 collections and over 600 short stories during his lifetime.<p><i>The Trimmed Lamp</i> follows <a href="http://librivox.org/the-four-million-by-o-henry/">The Four Million</a> and provides another series of short stories that take place in New York City in the early years of the 20th century and are representative of the surprise endings that popularized O. Henry’s work. They also capture his use of coincidence or chance to create humor in the story. O Henry wrote about ordinary people in everyday circumstances. He is quoted as once saying, “There are stories in everything. I’ve got some of my best yarns from park benches, lampposts and newspaper stands.”<p>I hope you enjoy the following readings as much as I enjoyed recording them.<p>(Summary by Marian Brown)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/16/items/trimmed_lamp_librivox/Trimmed_Lamp_Other_Stories_Four_Million_1109.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Trimmed Lamp: and other Stories of the Four Million</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/16/items/trimmed_lamp_librivox/Trimmed_Lamp_Other_Stories_Four_Million_1109.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#500f0b;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/trimmed_lamp_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
