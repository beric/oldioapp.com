(1) <i>Against Apion</i> is a two-volume defence of Judaism as classical religion and philosophy, stressing its antiquity, as opposed to what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judean allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion, and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.<br/><br/>

(2) <i>Discourse To The Greeks Concerning Hades </i>describes the author's views on the afterlife against the prevailing view of the "Greeks" (i.e., the Greco-Romans) of his day. Although generally still reprinted in editions of Whiston's <i>Josephus</i>, later scholars have realized that this attribution is incorrect. This brief discourse, at least in its original form, is now attributed to the church father Hippolytus.<br/><br/>

(3) <i>The Life of Josephus</i> is an autobiographical text written by Josephus in approximately 94-99 CE – possibly as an appendix to his <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i> – where the author for the most part re-visits the events of the War, apparently in response to allegations made against him by Justus of Tiberias.
