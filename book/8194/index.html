His books are redolent of the soil, and have such "freshness and primal sweetness," that we need not be told that the pleasure he gets from his walks and excursions is by no means over when he steps inside his doors again. As he tells us on more than one occasion, he finds he can get much more out of his outdoor experiences by thinking them over, and writing them out afterwards. These essays are delightful stories about birds, bees, foxes, hounds, fruit (the apple), trees, squirrles and nature in general written by a man who loves watching them and  writing about them.  - Summary by The introduction and Phil Chenevert<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/34/items/birdsandbeessharpeyesandotherpapers_1404_librivox/birds_and_bees_sharp_eyes_and_other_papers_1405.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Birds and Bees, Sharp Eyes, and Other Papers</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/34/items/birdsandbeessharpeyesandotherpapers_1404_librivox/birds_and_bees_sharp_eyes_and_other_papers_1405.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/birdsandbeessharpeyesandotherpapers_1404_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
