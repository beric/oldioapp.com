Crafty and powerful human opponents seek to skin him alive, bestial mutations seek to rip his arms off, denizens of the deep want to devour him whole and scantily clad dusky beauties try to waylay him at every step.  And all of this to find the Jewels of Gwahlur, the most fabulous treasure every hidden in a secret temple.  Has Conan finally met his match?  Will his evil enemies or the seductive women finally succeed in making him beg for mercy?  Listen and find out. Caution: there is some sex, lots of (justified) violence and the women are all equally voluptuous, independent, yielding and very dangerous. </p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/16/items/jewelsofgwahlur_pc_librivox/jewels_gwahlur_1303.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Jewels of Gwahlur</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/16/items/jewelsofgwahlur_pc_librivox/jewels_gwahlur_1303.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/jewelsofgwahlur_pc_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
