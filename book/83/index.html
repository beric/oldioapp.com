She suggested that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagined a social order founded on reason. - Today, Wollstonecraft is considered a foundational thinker in feminist philosophy.

Feminist scholars and activists have cited both her philosophical ideas and personal struggles as important influences in their work.
