Few women know how to cook an egg or boil a potato properly, and the making of the perfect loaf of bread has long been assigned a place among the "lost arts."

By many women cooking is considered, at best, a homely art,—a necessary kind of drudgery; and the composition, if not the consumption, of salads and chafing-dish productions has been restricted, hitherto, chiefly to that half of the race "who cook to please themselves." But, since women have become anxious to compete with men in any and every walk of life, they, too, are desirous of becoming adepts in tossing up an appetizing salad or in stirring a creamy rarebit. And yet neither a pleasing salad, especially if it is to be composed of cooked materials, nor a tempting rarebit can be evolved, save by happy accident, without an accurate knowledge of the fundamental principles that underlie all cookery. - Summary by the Preface"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/8/items/salads_sandwiches_chafing-dish_dainties_1707_librivox/salads_1707_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Salads, Sandwiches and Chafing-Dish Dainties</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/8/items/salads_sandwiches_chafing-dish_dainties_1707_librivox/salads_1707_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#b2a28b;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/salads_sandwiches_chafing-dish_dainties_1707_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
