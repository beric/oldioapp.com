It is a blunt, frightening, and detailed work with several moments of off-color humor. Mary, the wife of a minister, was captured by Natives during King Philip's War while living in a Lancaster town, most of which was decimated, and the people murdered. See through her eyes, which depict Indians as the instruments of Satan. Her accounts were a best-seller of the era, and a seminal work, being one of the first captivity narratives ever published by a woman. Without works such as hers, there would likely not be many modern works inspired by similar themes, such as The Searchers, starring John Wayne.(Summary by Matthew Scott Surprenant )"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/32/items/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox/Narrative_of_the_Captivity_and_Restoration_of_Mrs_Mary_Rowlandson_1002.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/32/items/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox/Narrative_of_the_Captivity_and_Restoration_of_Mrs_Mary_Rowlandson_1002.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f5ecdb;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/captivity_restoration_rowlandson_0912_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
