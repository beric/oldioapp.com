It was the second in order of Sophocles's composition of his three plays dealing with Oedipus. Thematically, however, it was the first in the trilogy's historical chronology, followed by Oedipus at Colonus and then Antigone.  "Oedipus the King" tells the story of Oedipus, a man who becomes the king of Thebes, whilst in the process unwittingly fulfilling a prophecy that he would kill his father Laius and marry his mother Jocasta.  The play is an example of classic tragedy, notably containing an emphasis upon how Oedipus's own faults contribute to his downfall (as opposed to making fate the sole cause). Over the centuries, "Oedipus Rex" has come to be regarded by many as the Greek tragedy par excellence. - Summary by Wikipedia (edited & supplemented by Expatriate)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/23/items/oedipusrex_1507_librivox/oedipus_rex_1507.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Oedipus Rex (Murray Translation)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/23/items/oedipusrex_1507_librivox/oedipus_rex_1507.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d0d0d0;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/oedipusrex_1507_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
