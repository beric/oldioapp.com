When the author had graduated from high school, she couldn't afford to go to college. In the summer of 1912, Vincent's sister, Norma, found work as a waitress at a hotel near where they lived. One night, Norma insisted that Vincent attend a masquerade ball, given at the hotel, if only to get Vincent out of the house and to meet people. Vincent finally gave in, and while there, sang songs and recited "Renascence," the first poem in this collection. This immediately won over the support of one "Miss Dow," who would help Vincent raise enough money to attend Vassar College. From there, she would meet others and become fully entrenched in, and later a major influence on, the literary community. (According to Savage Beauty, by Nancy Milford.)
