Throughout Pleasant Valley there was no one else so gentle as he . . . He was always tastefully dressed in fawn color and white. And except sometimes in the spring, when he needed a new coat, he was a real joy to see. For he both looked and acted like a well-bred little person."<br><br>In one of Bailey's "Sleepy-Time Tales", we follow a polite little mouse called Dickie as he hunts for a summer home, finds food, and avoids various predators. But winter is coming, and Dickie must look for a cozy place to sleep. He then makes a slight mistake, with results that could be disastrous -- or not. In this recording the voice of Dickie is read by five-year-old SuperCoconut, while her older sister narrates and reads the other characters.
