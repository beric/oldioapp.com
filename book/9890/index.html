Since it was written by his son, it is a little biased and we are not told anything about any crimes Jesse and his gang committed.  Some of the stories of Jesse's war adventures are a little hard to believe, but a good read nonetheless. - Summary by Barry Eads</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/8/items/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jesse_james_my_father_1505.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Jesse James, My Father</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/8/items/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox/jesse_james_my_father_1505.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#eddfba;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/jessejames_myfather_1505_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
