In fact, it was not until 1914, when Professor Karl Gehrkens at the Oberlin School of Music published this compilation of class notes and sources he collected over the years, that a uniform text became available for schools and universities everywhere. Since the publication of this monumental work, similar textbooks have emerged, but Dr. Gehrkens’ contribution remains thoroughly worthwhile—particularly since it provides not just the definitions of musical terms, but also the historical context of those terms. This inclusion enables students of music to better understand and remember those terms, and provides a platform from which Gehrkens argues for a uniform usage of musical terminology. Also included in the book are numerous musical excerpts, pictures, and actual analyses of musical examples.<br><br>

Recommended for the musically curious as well as the serious musical student.
