While it is hoped that this little work will prove of use to the members of the Legal and Medical Professions, it is intended to be suggestive rather than exhaustive—a primer not an encyclopædia; and it is not expected that it will obviate the necessity for frequent conferences between physicians and lawyers whenever, in the practice of either, questions arise requiring the experience of the other.
In most cases the very words of the judges and reporters have been used, and if any expressions are noticed that may be deemed over strong it will be found that they are the words of others: the author’s aim has been rather to act as an humble compiler and citer of cases, than to obtrude opinions or theories of his own.
Brief chapters on Dentists and Druggists have been given because of the intimate connection between these gentlemen and the members of the medical profession.
With great diffidence this book is committed to the tender mercies of the critics of these two learned professions—to those who can so effectually wield the pen, the tongue and the scalpel. - Summary by Robert Vashon Rogers - from the preface"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/law_medical_men_1802_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Law and Medical Men</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox/law_medical_men_1802_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#83d566;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/law_and_medicamen_1802_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
