Among his best known novels is The Odd Women, which was influenced by George Eliot, whose work he greatly admired. Another of his famous works, New Grub Street, entails a blunt critique of the working class life he knew by experience, especially during a number of the years he spent in the United States.<br /><br />This collection of stories ranges from the humorous to the tragic. Throughout, Gissing pokes mild fun at his characters' human frailties: egotism, self-satisfaction, and pomposity, among others. - Summary by Kirsten Wever"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/house_cobwebs_1704.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>House of Cobwebs and Other Stories</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/download/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox/house_cobwebs_1704.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/houseofcobwebs_1704_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
