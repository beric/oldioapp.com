Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of the modern Indian subcontinent. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_1505.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>First Jasmines</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox/firstjasmines_1505.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#c5710f;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/first_jasmines_1505.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
