He is quoted as saying, “Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.” This short anthology of haiku by Bashō and his pupils features poetry in their original Japanese, with translations and commentary in English by Basil Hall Chamberlain, a professor of Japanese at Tokyo Imperial University. - Summary by Wikipedia and Rob Board"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/5/items/basho_the_chief_poet_of_japan_1502_librivox/basho_chief_poet_japan_1502.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Basho, The Chief Poet of Japan and the Hokku, or Epigram Verses</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/5/items/basho_the_chief_poet_of_japan_1502_librivox/basho_chief_poet_japan_1502.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ece1cd;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/basho_the_chief_poet_of_japan_1502_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
