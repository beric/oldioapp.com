"Apology" here has its earlier meaning of speaking in defense of a cause or of one's beliefs or actions. The general term apology, in context to literature, defends a world from attack (opposite of satire-which attacks the world).the text is written in the first person from Socrates' point of view, as though it were Socrates' actual speech at the trial. During the course of the speech, Socrates twice mentions Plato as being present.  There is, however, no real way of knowing how closely Socrates' words in the Apology match those of Socrates at the actual trial, even if it was Plato's intention to be accurate in this respect - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/apologyversion2_1412_librivox/Apology_1501.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Apology (version 2)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/apologyversion2_1412_librivox/Apology_1501.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#494748;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/apologyversion2_1412_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
