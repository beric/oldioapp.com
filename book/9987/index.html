While most of his works are largely unknown, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies.
At the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Roman Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870–1953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous "Fighting 69th") in 1917. He was killed by a sniper's bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31.  - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarm_clocks_1506.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Alarm Clocks</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox/alarm_clocks_1506.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/alarm_clocks_1506.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
