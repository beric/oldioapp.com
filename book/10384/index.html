It is a fictional autobiography written by Ethelwyn Percivale, or 'Wynnie'. Her father is a clergyman, Mr. Walton, whose history has already been told in "A Quiet Neighborhood", the first of the three books. Wynnie has a happy childhood and falls in love with a struggling artist. It is about Wynnie and her family, and her little circle of old and new friends. We learn much about the poor of society of that time. This book is set in the real, every-day world, and our narrator is serious when she calls her life ''quiet and ordinary''. Though there are some exciting incidents, visits made, and long conversations about God. This book is a delightful read. - Summary by fiddlesticksThe trilogy:Annals of a Quiet NeighbourhoodThe Seaboard ParishThe Vicar's Daughter"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/29/items/vicarsdaughter_1608_librivox/vicars_daughter_1609.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Vicar's Daughter</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/29/items/vicarsdaughter_1608_librivox/vicars_daughter_1609.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#98a555;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/vicarsdaughter_1608_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
