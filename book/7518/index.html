Oblomov is also the central character of the novel, often seen as the ultimate incarnation of the superfluous man, a symbolic character in 19th-century Russian literature. Oblomov is a young, generous nobleman who seems incapable of making important decisions or undertaking any significant actions. Spoiled as a child to the point of not even being able to put on his own socks, Oblomov is unprepared to deal with the smallest difficulty of adult life. In his fevered dreams he sees the words "Oblomovstchina" ("Oblomovism" or in this translation "the disease of Oblomovka") in flaming letters on the ceiling putting a name to the disability of which he is all too aware.This romantic novel was considered a satire of Russian nobility whose social and economic function was increasingly in question in mid-nineteenth century Russia, and from it the word "Oblomovstchina" entered the Russian vocabulary. (Summary by Wikipedia and Kevin Davidson)Note: This 1915 edition was abridged by the translator."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/0/items/oblomov_kwd_librivox/Oblomov_1303.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Oblomov</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/0/items/oblomov_kwd_librivox/Oblomov_1303.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#eff1e3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/oblomov_kwd_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
