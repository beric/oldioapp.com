Service" /><meta name="og:description" content="Reputedly the best-selling poetry collection of the 20th century, 'Songs of a Sourdough' is best known for Robert W. Service's classic Yukon ballads, 'The Shooting of Dan McGrew' and 'The Cremation of Sam McGhee'. Service was born in Preston, Lancashire, and grew up in Scotland. In his twenties, he made his way to Canada and settled in the Yukon where he worked as a bank clerk but evidently dreamed of more adventurous pursuits. Service's readings of his poems show that he could adopt either a Scottish or North American accent. Here they are read in an accent that is not too far removed from the place of his birth. - Summary by Phil Benson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/songsofasourdough_1310_librivox/songs_sourdough_1310.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Songs of a Sourdough</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/songsofasourdough_1310_librivox/songs_sourdough_1310.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#435035;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/songsofasourdough_1310_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
