For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a Chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of authentic history. The Chair is made to pass from one to another of those personages, of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken legs, it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever a historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat. - Summary from Preface by Nathaniel Hawthorne"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/truestorieshistorybiography_1407_librivox/true_stories_from_history_and_biography_1407.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>True Stories from History and Biography</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/truestorieshistorybiography_1407_librivox/true_stories_from_history_and_biography_1407.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#0f121a;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/truestorieshistorybiography_1407_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
