Grace Abounding follows Bunyan’s struggle to find true repentance and forgiveness, his battle with Satan’s temptations of unbelief, his comfort found in the Bible and his overarching victory gotten by the grace of God through Jesus Christ his Son. Readers familiar with Pilgrim’s Progress will recognize that many of the allegorical points in his famous work came out of Bunyan’s own struggles and discoveries, and it has been said that Bunyan could not have written Pilgrim’s Progress without first going through the battles chronicled in Grace Abounding. (Summary by Stephen Escalera)NOTE: Paragraphs 319-339 from "A Brief Account of the Author’s Imprisonment" are omitted from the e-text, and are therefore omitted from this recording."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/grace_abounding-2_0806_librivox/Grace_Abounding_Chief_Sinners_1112.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/grace_abounding-2_0806_librivox/Grace_Abounding_Chief_Sinners_1112.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/grace_abounding-2_0806_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
