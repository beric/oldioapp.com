The spill disrupted an entire region's economy, damaged fisheries and critical habitats, and brought vividly to light the risks of deepwater drilling for oil and gas - the latest frontier in the national energy supply. Soon after, President Barack Obama appointed a seven-member Commission to investigate the disaster, analyze its causes and effects, and recommend the actions necessary to minimize such risks in the future.<br/><br/>The Commission's report offers the American public and policymakers alike the fullest account available of what happened in the Gulf and why, and proposes actions - changes in company behavior, reform of government oversight, and investments in research and technology - required as industry moves forward to meet the nation's energy needs.
