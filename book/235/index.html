Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children’s story-telling tradition. This is the second section of that work and will carry you from the convoluted and bloody ‘Wars of the Roses’ up to the death of Queen Victoria and the resolution of the Boer War. Please be advised that this book was written in the early years of the 20th century and there will be words and phrases used then, in all innocence, that are considered politically incorrect in this age. It’s perfectly fine for children to listen to but please ensure there is someone on hand who can explain these terms in a mature fashion.(Summary by Jim)<br /><br />Part 1 of this book may be found at <a href="https://librivox.org/our-island-story-part-1-by-he-marshall/" target="_blank">https://librivox.org/our-island-story-part-1-by-he-marshall/</a>.<br /><br />
