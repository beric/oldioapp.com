Rule" /><meta name="og:description" content=""The origin of the domestic cat (Felis domestica) is a subject about which there has been much conjecture and scientific discussion, but without any positive issue. Very long before the cat was kept in this country as a domesticated animal it was possessed by the ancient Egyptians in a tame state, and was, moreover, held in reverence by that remarkable and superstitious people, being regarded sacred to the goddess Pasht. As the domestic cat in different parts of the world will breed occasionally with the wild races of the locality, and as cats are conveyed from country to country, it is probable that our cats are of somewhat compound pedigree. It is considered probable that our fine English tabbies have a trace of the British wild-cat blood in their veins, although it may be obscure." - Summary by the author<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/thecatitsnaturalhistoryvarietiesandmanagement_1402_librivox/The_cat_its_Natural_History_Varieties_And_management_1402.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Cat: Its Natural History, Varieties and Management</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/thecatitsnaturalhistoryvarietiesandmanagement_1402_librivox/The_cat_its_Natural_History_Varieties_And_management_1402.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#131313;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/thecatitsnaturalhistoryvarietiesandmanagement_1402_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
