Chandler is one of these unfortunate victims, the perpetrator of rape and murder.  He is driven out of his community as a Hoaxer (someone who feigns being a victim of the plague), branded on his forehead with the letter H.  But he is not feigning.  In his travels, he finds the source of the plague, and it's not what people think.  It's up to him to deal with it, and he does.  But to what end? - Summary by Nick Bulka</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/34/items/plague_pythons_1606_librivox/plague_pythons_1606.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Plague of Pythons</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/34/items/plague_pythons_1606_librivox/plague_pythons_1606.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#258caa;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/plague_pythons_1606_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
