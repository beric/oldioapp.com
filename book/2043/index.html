She is considered unsinkable. Her full speed crossings of the Northern Lane Route carry her rich passengers in the highest standards of luxury and comfort. The less well-off travel in rougher quarters but still benefit from the speed of travel. These crossings, however, are fraught with navigational hazards, the greatest of which is ice.<br /><br />Unlike the ship, one member of her crew is not of the highest standard. At least, not anymore. John Rowland is a broken man who drinks to forget his past. However, when the Titan crashes into an iceberg during her attempt to break a speed record, he is forced to confront his past. Can he overcome his enemies and escape as the ship begins to sink? And can he make his way back to civilization and find self-respect once more? Adventure and soul-searching await Rowland, with a surprise ending.</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/3/items/futility_tw_librivox/Futility_1204.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Futility, Or the Wreck of the Titan</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/3/items/futility_tw_librivox/Futility_1204.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e9e9e9;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/futility_tw_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
