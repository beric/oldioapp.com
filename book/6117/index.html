On the voyage, he meets Euphemia Smith and they conduct an indiscreet affair aboard.
After various problems, Caldigate literally strikes gold and returns to England. On his return, Caldigate meets and marries a previous acquaintance, Hester Bolton, and they have a son. He sets himself up as his father’s heir and life seems perfect. However, Euphemia suddenly reappears and claims they were married in Australia, making Caldigate a bigamist and his son illegitimate.
