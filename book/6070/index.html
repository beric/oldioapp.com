He is best known for his catechetical trilogy: The Endowments of Man, The Groundwork of the Christian Virtues, and Christian Patience, published in the 1880s. The Groundwork of the Christian Virtues is presented in sixteen lectures, wherein Bishop Ullathorne makes the case that the virtue of humility is the foundation of all virtues, especially of the three theological virtues and the four cardinal moral virtues. The theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity have God Himself as their object, and the four cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance show one how to cultivate the theological virtues in one's daily life.
