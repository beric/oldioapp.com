It was published in serial form between 1918-1920 and first published in book form in 1922.  The story follows Leopold Bloom through Dublin during the course of one day: June 16, 1904.  The events and characters of Ulysses parallel those of Homer's Odyssey, with Bloom corresponding to Odysseus.  Although the book was the subject of early obscenity prosecutions, was banned in several countries, and has been considered unreadable by many, it is nevertheless one of the most important English-language works of the 20th century and is undoubtedly a masterpiece of Modernist literature.  To this day, the 16th of June is celebrated as Bloomsday by Joyce enthusiasts.
