The widow of the Baron of Avenel and her daughter seek safety with Elspeth in her tower. Hearing the baroness's deathbed confession, Father Philip notices her Bible. As he carries it to the Lord Abbot, it is taken from him by a White Lady. A sub-prior investigates this story and finds that the Bible is now back in the owner's hands. Later, Elspeth's son sees the White Lady when he snatches the Bible from a flaming altar. Intrigue follows intrigue. Halbert and Sir Piercie Shafton fight, and Halbert flees, leaving Sir Piercie mortally wounded. Shafton, however, recovers only to be accused of murdering Edward's missing brother. Mysie helps Shafton escape from jail. Edward has vowed to become a monk at the urging of the White Lady. After a battle between English and Scottish soldiers against Sir John's troops, Mysie is declared a suitable wife for Sir Piercie. The monks are allowed to keep their monastery.
