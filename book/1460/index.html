Other favorites were picked up along the way as she read to her own daughter and to her students, while other gems were discovered while looking for poems and stories to include in this collection. It is hoped that this collection will bless the hearts of many children and parents alike as they listen together."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/16/items/grandma_janice_01_librivox/Grandma_Janices_Poems_Stories_1110.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Grandma Janice's Poems and Stories</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/16/items/grandma_janice_01_librivox/Grandma_Janices_Poems_Stories_1110.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#8e814c;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/grandma_janice_01_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
