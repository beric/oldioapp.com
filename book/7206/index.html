Almost all of us are, you know.  Well, these 12 stories were written by Maud Lindsay to be told by someone who can weave the magic thread of speech into a performance that will hold the children spellbound.  And we don't need to be perfect, just willing to tell a story; that is really all children ask, someone willing to tell a story.  8 of Librivox's Story tellers have volunteered to tell these enchanting tales (and sometimes sing the sweet little melodies that are included.)   "It was a glad day in the olden time when the Story Teller came to cottage or hall. At Christmas, or New Year; when the May pole stood on the village green; or the chestnuts were roasting in the coals on All hallows eve; come when he would, he was always welcome; and if, when he was least expected, he knocked at the door, what joy there was!Perhaps the story brought with it laughter, or perhaps a tear, but Life, said the Story Teller, is made up of smiles and tears; and the little ones, listening to him, learned to rejoice with those whose joy was great, and to mourn with the sorrowful; and were the better and not the worse for it. And so in due time grew into noble men and good women.Open the door and let him come in, give him a seat by the fire and gather close about him. And then you shall hear!"
