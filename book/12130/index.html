Allen regularly communicates this by providing examples on how the laws which govern the inner-world (of thought) operate in a manner similar to the laws of nature. Free from speculative philosophies, ideals, and dogma; it provides highly practical guidance on how to bring about lasting changes in any area of one’s life.<br /><br />Part two (titled ‘The Way of Peace’) dives deeper into the concept of self-perfection and was later published as a separate book.<br /><br />Excerpt from forward:
“And I dreamed of writing a book which should help men and women, whether rich or poor, learned or unlearned, worldly or unworldly, to find within themselves the source of all success, all happiness, all accomplishment, all truth.”<br /><br />Written to appeal to the wider audience (in simple, modern English), its timeless wisdom is as relevant and attainable in today’s age as ever.
