Catching wind of this publicity stunt, John Brisben Walker, who had just purchased the three-year-old and still-fledging Cosmopolitan, decided to dispatch Bisland on her own journey.] Six hours after being recruited, Bisland departed westward from New York. Meanwhile, Bly left on a steamer headed to Europe, both on the same day—November 14, 1889. The journeys were keenly followed by the public, though Bly, sponsored by the more sensationalistic and popular New York World (which mainly ignored Bisland), appeared to get more attention than Bisland and the genteel Cosmopolitan, which only published monthly. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/15/items/flyingtrip_1610_librivox/in_seven_stages_1610.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>In Seven Stages: A Flying Trip Around the World by Elizabeth Bisland</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/15/items/flyingtrip_1610_librivox/in_seven_stages_1610.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#edeae5;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/flyingtrip_1610_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
