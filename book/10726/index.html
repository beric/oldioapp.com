As the poetic art in Canada has had little of an appreciable past, it may therefore be thought that the songs that are to catch and retain the ear of the nation lie still in the future, and are as yet unsung. Doubtless the chords have yet to be struck that are to give to Canada the songs of her loftiest genius; but he would be an ill friend of the country's literature who would slight the achievements of the present in reaching solely after what, it is hoped, the coming time will bring.

But whatever of lyrical treasure the future may enshrine in Canadian literature, and however deserving may be the claims of the volumes of verse that have already appeared from the native press, I am bold to claim for these productions of Mrs. MacLean's muse a high place in the national collection and a warm corner in the national heart. - Summary by G. Mercer Adam, in the preface."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/coming_of_the_princess_1605_librivox/comingprincess_1605.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Coming of the Princess, and Other Poems</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/coming_of_the_princess_1605_librivox/comingprincess_1605.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#3f2822;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/coming_of_the_princess_1605_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
