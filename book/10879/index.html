The freedom, flexibility and speed (!) that this modern invention provided to those who were wealthy enough to be able to afford to buy and to run one of these vehicles, meant that they were soon used for frequent social and pleasure purposes allowing both the travelling to and the exploration of different regions of the country.

This book, from 1907: ‘Through East Anglia in a Motor Car’, documents numerous journeys that the author, accompanied by various passengers and friends had undertaken during the previous year, using various vehicles popular at that time.

Although mention is made in the text of different motor cars used for the various trips, such as those manufactured by Panhard, Lanchester, and Rolls Royce (a 1906 Grey Ghost, no less), there is not too much reported about the running and maintenance of them. The  author however, does seem to be really pleased when on a fine day and faced with a clear open road and a back wind,  he and his passengers are able to cover a good thirty miles in an hour and half. 

Strictly speaking, East Anglia is made up of three counties, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. In writing this guide book and to make it more relevant and appealing to the car owning Londoner, the author has expanded this region to also include anywhere north of Tower Bridge on the River Thames, thus including central and east London as well as the entire county of Essex in his journeys.

These expeditions take us to many places that nowadays are very much ‘off the beaten track’ but were, a century ago, very much on the main ‘tracks’ through this region. But, it is not only routes and locations that have been written about. The author also includes numerous details and stories of the area’s historical events, geographical and architectural features, customs, legends and myths that will give the listener an appreciation of an area of England that has an extremely fascinating cultural heritage.

So, start your engines and join me if you will, on an auditory journey of discovery around an understated yet unique part of England as it was at the turn of the last century. - Summary by TND"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/througheastangliainamotorcar_1612_librivox/through_east_anglia_1701.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Through East Anglia In A Motor Car</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/througheastangliainamotorcar_1612_librivox/through_east_anglia_1701.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#7f4f4b;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/througheastangliainamotorcar_1612_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
