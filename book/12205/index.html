The way in which Sganarelle is dubbed, or rather drubbed a doctor, is highly amusing; and the cure of the dumb girl, and the use which she makes of her recovered speech, contains a philosophical lesson which may be sometimes applied to the way in which nouveaux riches spread their newly acquired wealth. The learned and anatomical disquisitions between Sganarelle and Geronte are also very entertaining, as well as the growth of greed in the rustic physician. - Summary by The Translator
