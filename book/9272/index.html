Medal of Honor is an intriguing look into the mind of someone who is above the law; who cannot commit a crime.  How will he act? especially if he is a self centered drunk?  Potential Enemy is story about the sad state of human minds that are ruled by fear and paranoia.  Happy Ending is an SF story about the far future when the last solar system wide dictator has been finally defeated and what will he do?  What will he do? This is also an exploration of mental megalomania and it's effects.  His happy ending is perhaps suitable, but probably not so happy.   A Gun For Hire explores in a light hearted but painful way, the fact that hired guns are just that: hired.  The final story is the funniest of the lot the and is set in Tangiers in the present or very near future.  UFO's are a crackpot idea, right?  well perhaps not.  - Summary by Phil Chenevert</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/5storiesbymackreynolds_1410_librivox/5_science_fiction_1411.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>5 Science Fiction Stories by Mac Reynolds</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/5storiesbymackreynolds_1410_librivox/5_science_fiction_1411.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#edebdc;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/5storiesbymackreynolds_1410_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
