Though living very simply, tending cows, goats, sheep and rabbits, Paula has been brought up to know and love the Lord Jesus and read the Scriptures. Her Lord and His Word are the center of her life, and she can no more keep this good news all to herself than she can stop breathing or eating.
This causes a good many complications, for her cousins' home was one where "religion" was a forbidden subject, never to be mentioned, and Paula soon found herself forbidden to read her own precious Bible.

Paula's loving obedience, her happy friendliness and charm, her overflowing love for everyone she meets, win the hearts of all, family and neighbors alike, and cause many a change in that little French village on the road from Rouen to Darnetal.

This book was originally written in French, Translated into Spanish, and then into English.
