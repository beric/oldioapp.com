Cavell (1865–1915) was a British nurse who attended to soldiers of both sides during World War I, and helped some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium, for which she was arrested, court-martialed, found guilty of treason and sentenced to death. Attempts to mount an appeal failed, and she was summarily executed within hours of the sentence by a German firing squad. Publication of the news prompted spontaneous grief and worldwide condemnation. Many memorials were created around the world, including a statue adjacent to Trafalgar Square in London. --Adapted from Wikipedia

NOTE: After recording Chapter 7, the reader became aware that the subject's family pronounced the surname as it rhymes with "gravel", and he therefore pronounces it CAvel in subsequent chapters.

The first edition of this book was published in 1916. The final portion of Chapter 15 is from a later edition.
