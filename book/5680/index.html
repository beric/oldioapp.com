Do you cut sticks for our fire o' mornings?" Thus spoke Master Hugh Fitzooth, King's Ranger of the Forest at Locksley, as he entered his house.

<br /><br />Robin flushed a little. "These are arrows, sir," he announced, holding one up for inspection.

<br /><br />Dame Fitzooth smiled upon the boy as she rose to meet her lord. "What fortune do you bring us to-day, father?" asked she, cheerily.

<br /><br />Fitzooth's face was a mask of discontent. "I bring myself, dame," answered he, "neither more nor less."

<br /><br />"Surely that is enough for Robin and me!" laughed his wife. "Come, cast off your shoes, and give me your bow and quiver. I have news for you, Hugh, even if you have none for us. George of Gamewell has sent his messenger to-day, and bids me bring Robin to him for the Fair." She hesitated to give the whole truth.
