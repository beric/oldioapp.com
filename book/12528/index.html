Critical evaluations of Noguchi, while varying drastically, have frequently stressed the enigmatic character of his work. Arthur Symons referred to him as a "scarcely to be apprehended personality." Arthur Ransome called him "a poet whose poems are so separate that a hundred of them do not suffice for his expression." Ezra Pound, on first reading The Pilgrimage in 1911 wrote that "His poems seem to be rather beautiful. I don't quite know what to think about them." Nishiwaki Junzaburō wrote, "Most of his earlier poems have always seemed to me so terrific, so bewildering, as to startle me out of reason or system." - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/25/items/selected_poems_of_yone_noguchi_1801_librivox/SelectedNoguchi_1712_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Selected Poems of Yone Noguchi</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/25/items/selected_poems_of_yone_noguchi_1801_librivox/SelectedNoguchi_1712_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/selected_poems_of_yone_noguchi_1801_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
