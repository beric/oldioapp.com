Thompson, considered a classic and elegant introduction to the subject. (from Wikipedia) <br><br>
 
<i>Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.
Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.</i> (from the Prologue)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/32/items/calculus_made_easy_1608_librivox/calculusmadeeasy_1608.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Calculus Made Easy</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/32/items/calculus_made_easy_1608_librivox/calculusmadeeasy_1608.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#faf1ca;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/calculus_made_easy_1608_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
