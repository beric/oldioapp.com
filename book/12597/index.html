Ever been upstanding and righteous, only to have those around you take advantage of you? In the most unique of circumstances, watch a woman flee from a lavish world of slavery in a brothel, to live in the muck and mire of squalor. With the law chasing after her, The Girl from Farris' must find a way to merely survive. And in other parts of town, watch an upstanding citizen go from Riches to Rags as his fiance' and business partners slowly tear down the soul of the man. Watch as these two paths collide at different points in their lives. Will it be happily ever after, or a bitter end?
