This collection also contains some poems written right after World War I, reflecting the state of international politics very impressively. "This miscellaneous volume is composed of three sections. The first twelve poems were written in 1913, and printed privately by Mr. Hornby in 1914.
The last of these poems proved to be a “war poem,” and on that follow eighteen pieces which were called forth on occasion during the War, the last being a broadsheet on the surrender of the German ships. All of these verses appeared in some journal or serial. There were a few others, but they are not included in this collection, either because they are lost, or because they show decidedly inferior claims to salvage.
The last six poems or sonnets are of various dates." - Summary by Carolin"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/october_and_other_poems_1710_librivox/octoberb_1710_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>October and Other Poems</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/october_and_other_poems_1710_librivox/octoberb_1710_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#837d71;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/october_and_other_poems_1710_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
