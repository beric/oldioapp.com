The purpose is to suggest a few of the many aspects which music may have even to the mind of a child. If these chapters, or whatever may be logically suggested by them, be actually used as the basis of simple Talks with children, music may become to them more than drill and study. They should know it as an art, full of beauty and of dignity; full of pure thought and abounding in joy. Music with these characteristics is the true music of the heart. Unless music gives true pleasure to the young it may be doubted if it is wisely studied.
<br><br>
Our failure to present music to the young in a manner that interests and holds them is due not so much to the fact that music is too difficult for children, but because the children themselves are too difficult for us. In our ignorance we often withhold the rightful inheritance. We must not forget that the slower adult mind often meets a class of difficulties which are not recognized by the unprejudiced child. It is not infrequent that with the old fears in us we persist in recreating difficulties."</i>  (From the Preface) </p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/music_talks_children_1507_librivox/music_talks_with_children_1507.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Music Talks With Children</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/music_talks_children_1507_librivox/music_talks_with_children_1507.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#b5a180;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/music_talks_children_1507_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
