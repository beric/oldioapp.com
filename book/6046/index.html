They point out the right way in the devious paths of life. Have we not often stood at the juncture of two roads, the one of righteousness and the other of unfaithfulness, and was it not then that some golden little book acted the part of an opportune adviser and directed us down the highway of truth? Is there one of us who can truthfully say that good books have not been his loyal and trustworthy helpers, his vigilant guardians in life's intricate ways? This unpretentious little book of goodness stories, a companion volume to "Tell Us Another," must speak for itself.This is a charming volume of short stories for Catholic children. In it are 48 stories designed to teach morals and the truths of the faith. (Summary from the introduction to the book and Maria Therese)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/juststories_mt_librivox/juststories_1204.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Just Stories: The Kind That Never Grow Old</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/juststories_mt_librivox/juststories_1204.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#feffd3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/juststories_mt_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
