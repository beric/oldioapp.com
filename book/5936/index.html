Palestine!<br /><br />No war correspondents, no Red Cross or relief committees have gone to Palestine, because no actual fighting has taken place there, and yet hundreds of thousands are suffering there that worst of agonies, the agony of the spirit.<br /><br />Those who have devoted their lives to show the world that Palestine can be made again a country flowing with milk and honey, those who have dreamed of reviving the spirit of the prophets and the great teachers, are hanged and persecuted and exiled, their dreams shattered, their holy places profaned, their work ruined. Cut off from the world, with no bread to sustain the starving body, the heavy boot of a barbarian soldiery trampling their very soul, the dreamers of Palestine refuse to surrender, and amidst the clash of guns and swords they are battling for the spirit with the weapons of the spirit.<br /><br />The time has not yet come to write the record of these battles, nor even to attempt to render justice to the sublime heroes of Palestine. This book is merely the story of some of the personal experiences of one who has done less and suffered less than thousands of his comrades.(Summary from the Introduction) <p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/withturkspalestine_1301_librivox/withturkspalestine_1301.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>With the Turks in Palestine</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/withturkspalestine_1301_librivox/withturkspalestine_1301.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e6e6e6;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/withturkspalestine_1301_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
