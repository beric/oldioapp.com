Paul prays for the spiritual well-being of the Ephesians and reminds them how sinful they were before they turned to Christ. He then speaks of his revelation, by which he was selected to preach to the Gentiles, for they can also be saved. Among other things, he urges the Ephesians to be humble, to avoid sexual immorality and foul speech, and to be united in Christ even though they are diverse in spiritual talents. He also gives advice to husbands and wives, children and fathers, and servants and masters. The letter concludes with an extended metaphor of the Christian as spiritual warrior.
