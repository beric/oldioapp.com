Its variegated cast of characters includes Vera Pavlovna, a boldly independent woman in a time of great oppression, and the inspirational radical Rakhmetov.  The author wrote the novel from the depths of the infamous Peter & Paul Fortress of St. Petersburg, the Abu Ghraib of tsarist Russia, and later spent many years of exile in Siberia.  Dostoyevsky disparaged Chernyshevsky's novel repeatedly, most notably in The Possessed (as sort of bedside reading material for some of the more despicable characters) and in Notes From Underground.  Chernyshevsky's legacy, however, was in inspiring an ascetic, self-abnegating radicalism in later revolutionaries and activists. - Summary by Expatriate</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/28/items/avitalquestion_1409_librivox/vital_question_1409.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Vital Question, or, What is to be Done?</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/28/items/avitalquestion_1409_librivox/vital_question_1409.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#b8b8b8;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/avitalquestion_1409_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
