It has been my continual prayer that God might use what is written to increase in His children the conviction that we must be holy, the knowledge of how we are to be holy, the joy that we may be holy, the faith that we can be holy. And may He stir us all to cry day and night to Him for a visitation of the Spirit and the Power of Holiness upon all His people, that the name of Christian and of saint may be synonymous, and every believer be a vessel made holy and meet for the Master’s use.” - Summary by Christopher Smith, quoting Andrew Murray<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/21/items/holy_in_christ_1311_librivox/Holy_Christ_1312.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Holy in Christ</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/21/items/holy_in_christ_1311_librivox/Holy_Christ_1312.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f3f3f3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/holy_in_christ_1311_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
