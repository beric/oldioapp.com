Field first started publishing poetry in 1879, when his poem "Christmas Treasures" appeared in A Little Book of Western Verse. Over a dozen volumes of poetry followed and he became well known for his light-hearted poems for children, among the most famous of which are "Wynken, Blynken, and Nod" and "The Duel" (which is perhaps better known as "The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat"). Equally famous is his poem about the death of a child, "Little Boy Blue". Field also published a number of short stories, including "The Holy Cross" and "Daniel and the Devil." - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/dr_sam_1606.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Dr. Sam</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox/dr_sam_1606.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#988b79;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/dr_sam_1606.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
