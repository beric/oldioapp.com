The trilogy is sometimes referred to as the Oedipodea.  It concerns the battle between an Argive army led by Polynices and the army of Thebes led by Eteocles and his supporters.  The trilogy won the first prize at the City Dionysia. The trilogy's first two plays, Laius and Oedipus, as well as the satyr play Sphinx, are no longer extant.  When Oedipus, King of Thebes, realized he had married his own mother and had two sons and two daughters with her, he blinded himself and cursed his sons to divide their inheritance (the kingdom) by the sword. The two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, in order to avoid bloodshed, agreed to rule Thebes in alternate years. After the first year, Eteocles refused to step down, leading Polynices to raise an army of Argives (captained by the eponymous Seven) to take Thebes by force....The bulk of the play consists of rich dialogues between the citizens of Thebes and their king Eteocles regarding the threat of the hostile army before their gates. - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/30/items/sevenagainstthebes_way_1512_librivox/seven_against_thebes_way_1512.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Seven Against Thebes (Way Translation)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/30/items/sevenagainstthebes_way_1512_librivox/seven_against_thebes_way_1512.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#040205;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/sevenagainstthebes_way_1512_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
