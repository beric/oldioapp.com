Of course there are things missing: she does not remember her mother who died when she was young. But at least she has her father... Until he unexpectedly dies. Now Eleanor is at the mercy of her half-siblings who were never in touch with her, and the rest of the world who would consider her an orphaned beggar. Sent to work as a lady's companion to an old friend of her late father's, Eleanor might, just might, be able to win a respectable place in society. This novel is also famous for being one of the first Victorian novels with a female detective. - Summary by Stav Nisser</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/28/items/eleanorsvictory_1605_librivox/eleanors_victory_1605.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Eleanor's Victory</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/28/items/eleanorsvictory_1605_librivox/eleanors_victory_1605.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f3eac9;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/eleanorsvictory_1605_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
