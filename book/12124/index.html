The incidents which make up the story are introduced to illustrate the moral status of the youth, at the beginning, and to develop the influences from which proceeded a gentle and Christian character. Mollie, the captain's daughter, whose simple purity of life, whose filial devotion to an erring parent, and whose trusting faith in the hour of adversity, won the love and respect of Noddy, was not the least of these influences.  The fifth book in the series is Hope and Have; or, Fanny Grant Among the Indians.   - Summary by Scarlett Martin from Book Preface"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/work_and_win_1708_librivox/noddy_newman_1708_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Work and Win; Noddy Newman on a Cruise</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/work_and_win_1708_librivox/noddy_newman_1708_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#dddddf;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/work_and_win_1708_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
