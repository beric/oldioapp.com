The materials include course books, modern grammars and traditional Arabic grammatical works, including the Ajurrumiyyah of Ibn Ajurrum and the Mi'at Amil of Jurjani. They each focus on different aspects of the two core science of Arabic grammar, viz. nahw (syntax) and sarf (morphology). Some of the Arabic-language materials come from religious books, such as the Holy Qur’án, which has been studied by new students of Arabic for more than a thousand years, as well as al-Kitábu’l-’Aqdas (the Most Holy Book) of Bahá’u’lláh, which comes from the most recent of the Abrahamic religions. I hope that this collection will provide the student with the tools he or she needs to begin studying the Arabic language. Listening to audio materials, however useful, must be combined with study of the writing system, reading written texts and practical exercise of the language. (Summary by Nicholas J.
