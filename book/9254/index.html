H. Lawrence" /><meta name="og:description" content="Flutist Aaron Sisson is caught up in the aftermath of WWI. A lost soul, he attempts to find himself in the comfort of bar-room talk and alcohol and a woman. Moving on, he spends time with a mining executive's relatives. But he finds the family a stuffy middle-class lot, bored with each other and themselves. He leaves his wife and children and strikes out for the open road. During a playing engagement at an opera performance, he reunites with the mining executive's family. Talk is of love and war, none of it very satisfying to anyone. At dinner with one of the women, Aaron reveals that he is indifferent to most things in life and just wants to be left alone. So it goes with this lost soul among lost souls. One wonders how he will ever find himself or happiness. - Summary by Bill Boerst"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/22/items/aarons_rod_1601_librivox/Aaronsrod_1601.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Aaron's Rod</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/22/items/aarons_rod_1601_librivox/Aaronsrod_1601.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#8e9ba4;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/aarons_rod_1601_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
