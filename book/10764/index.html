It was written for serialisation in 1853 when Dickens was at the peak of his career. Monthly sales substantially exceeded his previous bestseller David Copperfield.<br></br>Dickens' mastery of the English language comes to the fore in this book. It is an energetic book: a complex mystery story revolving around the heroine Esther Summerson and her path from childhood to marriage. During the course of Esther’s narration Dickens introduces some wonderful and unforgettable characters, and at the same time provides a searing indictment of the laws’ corruption and self-serving interests which prevailed during that time. He pokes fun at the languid and landed aristocracy and questions the societal indifference to the poor. Detection, black comedy, farce, and tragic ruin run through the story. Critics at the time were unenthusiastic but the public were enthralled by it! - Summary by Peter John Keeble"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/22/items/bleak_house_1705_librivox/bleak_house5_1706_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Bleak House (version 4)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/22/items/bleak_house_1705_librivox/bleak_house5_1706_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/bleak_house_1705_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
