"No man is better qualified to tell the story of Greenland, or the stories of its people. Knud Rasmussen is himself partly of Eskimo origin; his childhood was spent in Greenland, and to Greenland he returned again and again, studying, exploring, crossing the desert of the inland ice, making unique collections of material, tangible and otherwise, from all parts of that vast and little-known land, and his achievements on these various expeditions have gained for him much honour and the appreciation of many learned societies. But it is as an interpreter of native life, of the ways and customs of the Eskimos, that he has done his greatest work. Such work, as regards its hither side, must naturally consist to a great extent of scientific treatises, collections of facts and specimens, all requiring previous knowledge of the subject for their proper comprehension. These have their great value as additions to the sum of human knowledge, but they remain unknown to the majority of men. As regards their contents, the stories bring before us, more clearly, perhaps, than any objective study, the daily life of the Eskimos, their habit of thought, their conception of the universe, and the curious "spirit world" which forms their religion or mythology. In point of form they are unique." (W. W. Worster, ed. by Expatriate)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/0/items/eskimofolktales_1706_librivox/eskimofolktales_1706_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Eskimo Folk-Tales</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/0/items/eskimofolktales_1706_librivox/eskimofolktales_1706_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#a6beda;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/eskimofolktales_1706_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
