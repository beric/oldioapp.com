This was the Weekly Poetry project for August 21, 2011.Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was an American poet. Born in Amherst, Massachusetts, to a successful family with strong community ties, she lived a mostly introverted and reclusive life. Thought of as an eccentric by the locals, she became known for her penchant for white clothing and her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even leave her room. Most of her friendships were therefore carried out by correspondence.( Summary by Wikipedia)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/29/items/planktoplank_1108_librivox/I_Stepped_Plank_Plank_1210.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>I Stepped from Plank to Plank</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/29/items/planktoplank_1108_librivox/I_Stepped_Plank_Plank_1210.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#9f998d;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/planktoplank_1108_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
