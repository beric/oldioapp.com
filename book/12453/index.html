L. Mencken" /><meta name="og:description" content=""It was part of my daily work, for a good many years, to read the principal English newspapers and reviews; it has been part of my work, all the time, to read the more important English novels, essays, poetry and criticism. An American born and bred, I early noted, as everyone else in like case must note, certain salient differences between the English of England and the English of America as practically spoken and written—differences in vocabulary, in syntax, in the shades and habits of idiom, and even, coming to the common speech, in grammar. And I noted too, of course, partly during visits to England but more largely by a somewhat wide and intimate intercourse with English people in the United States, the obvious differences between English and American pronunciation and intonation.
 Greatly interested in these differences—some of them so great that they led me to seek exchanges of light with Englishmen—I looked for some work that would describe and account for them with a show of completeness, and perhaps depict the process of their origin. I soon found that no such work existed, either in England or in America—that the whole literature of the subject was astonishingly meagre and unsatisfactory." - Summary by Mencken (Preface)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/35/items/americanlanguage_1801_librivox/americanlanguage_1801_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>American Language</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/35/items/americanlanguage_1801_librivox/americanlanguage_1801_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#c99915;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/americanlanguage_1801_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
