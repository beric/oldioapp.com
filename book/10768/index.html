Included in that collection were the chapters which later formed the standalone work "Old Christmas."  This wonderful book introduced the world to Bracebridge Hall, the ancestral home of the Bracebridges, an old English family that lived according to the customs of those who were "unto the manor born."  "Bracebridge Hall" is a follow-up to "Old Christmas" which looks at the lifestyle of the rich, country dwellers, their servants, friends and neighbors.  The daily lives and adventures of this peculiar population of early 1800's England forms the foundation upon which the episodes explored in "Bracebridge Hall" is built.  Washington Irving wrote the book based upon his own experiences visiting England and the very real Bracebridge Family with whom he spent much time.  - Summary by Greg Giordano</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/bracebridge_hall_gg_mk_1606_librivox/bracebridgehall_1606.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Bracebridge Hall</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/bracebridge_hall_gg_mk_1606_librivox/bracebridgehall_1606.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#403020;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/bracebridge_hall_gg_mk_1606_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
