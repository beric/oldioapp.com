Stewart — Maria W. Stewart" /><meta name="og:description" content="<br />Maria W. Stewart was America's first black woman political writer.  Between 1831 and 1833, she gave four speeches on the topics of slavery and women's rights.  <em>Meditations From The Pen of Mrs. Maria W. Stewart</em>—published in 1879, shortly before her death—is a collection of those speeches as well as her memoir, some meditations and prayers.  They are political, poetical and sermon all at the same time; but in the mileu in which she lectured, they were a critically important part of the abolitionist movement years before the contributions of others such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth.  Her speeches and essays espoused a return to Christian values and morality, but also proposed fundamental changes in gender roles in the midst of tremendous public opposition to the rights of blacks and of women.
