Henry" /><meta name="og:description" content="<p>Born in 1862 and died in 1910, O. Henry’s birth name is William Sydney Porter; however, he adopted the pen name O. Henry while in prison. He published 10 collections and over 600 short stories during his lifetime.<p>The Four Million is the second book written by O. Henry while he served time for embezzlement in a penitentiary in Ohio. The book is a series of short stories which take place in New York City in the early years of the 20th century and are representative of the surprise endings that popularized O. Henry’s work. They also capture his use of coincidence or chance to create humor in the story. O Henry wrote about ordinary people in everyday circumstances. He is quoted as once saying, “There are stories in everything. I’ve got some of my best yarns from park benches, lampposts and newspaper stands.”<p>I hope you enjoy the following readings as much as I enjoyed recording them.<p>(Summary by Marian Brown)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/four_million_librivox/Four_Million_1104.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Four Million</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/four_million_librivox/Four_Million_1104.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/four_million_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
