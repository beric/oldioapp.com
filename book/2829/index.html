Babbitt is a complicated and conflicted character. When you think you have his next move figured out he surprises you. As you begin to like him, he does something to evoke the “what a rat” response.<BR><BR>
Male menopause wasn’t a pre Great Depression term, but I would say George has all the symptoms. At a pudgy balding forty six he looks at his life, wife, family and business. He sees himself as a pretty successful business man, but when Tanis, the lonely widow, has a leaky roof, he sees an opportunity for perhaps a more fulfilling relationship then he has at home. Add to Tanis a foray into radical politics, and we are about to whiteness an emotional and financial train wreck with Babbitt at the throttle.<BR><BR>
This is a long story, but well worth listening to. Human nature hasn’t changed much in the last ninety years. Enjoy the novel (Summary by Mike Vendetti).<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/16/items/babbitt_0903_librivox/Babbitt_1005.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Babbitt</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/16/items/babbitt_0903_librivox/Babbitt_1005.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#adc8d3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/babbitt_0903_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
