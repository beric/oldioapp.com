Bryant edited the very successful Picturesque America which was published between 1872 and 1874. This two-volume set was lavishly illustrated and described scenic places in the United States and Canada.
In his last decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse translation of Homer's works. He assiduously worked on the Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered as one of the principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of his father's enormous influence on him. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_1610.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>October - A Sonnet</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox/october_1610.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/october_a_sonnet_1610.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
