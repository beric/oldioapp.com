Some of the stories may have had a Chinese origin: the very remarkable "Dream of Akinosuke," for example, is certainly from a Chinese source. But the story-teller, in every case, has so recolored and reshaped his borrowing as to naturalize it… One queer tale, "Yuki-Onna," was told me by a farmer of Chofu, Nishitama-gori, in Musashi province, as a legend of his native village. Whether it has ever been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious forms… The incident of "Riki-Baka" was a personal experience; and I wrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a family-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.

Hearn, from the Introduction to the book)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/13/items/kwaidan_1005_librivox/kwaidan_1005.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/13/items/kwaidan_1005_librivox/kwaidan_1005.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#107547;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/kwaidan_1005_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
