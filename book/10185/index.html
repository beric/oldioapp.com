McIntyre was born in Forres, Scotland and came to Canada in 1841 at the age of 14, finally moving to Ingersoll, Ontario, then a town of 5,000 on the banks of the Thames in Oxford County, the heart of Canadian dairy country at the time. He opened a furniture factory on the river as well as a store which sold furniture, along with such items as pianos and coffins.

He was well loved in the community, from which he often received aid in hard times, due in part to his poesy and oratorical skills—he was called on to speak at every kind of social gathering in Ingersoll. The region seems to have inspired him, and it was in celebration of the proud history of Canada, the natural beauty and industry of the region, and especially (as noted above) its cheese, that the majority of his oeuvre was written. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/16/items/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/Tramp_Fish_1508.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Tramp and Fish</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/16/items/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox/Tramp_Fish_1508.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/tramp_and_fish_1508.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
