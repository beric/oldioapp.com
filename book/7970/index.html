It is about Titus, a young man living in the time of Christ. He is a part of the lowest class of society, his father is a thief, and Titus' brother, whom He is very attached to, is a cripple. Titus and his brother, Stephen, abhor the life of their father, yet Titus has no choice but to join him and the rest of the group of law breakers and thieves occasionally. He yearns for somthing better. One day he hears of Jesus. Titus and Stephen learn more about him, as they hear and see more of Jesus and his disciples, they have some very difficult choices to make. Along the way Titus meets Barabbas, Jesus Mother, Mary, and has some incredible experiences. This story takes you not only to the very foot of the cross, but to the three crosses themselves. The ending is very unexpected, and may seem rather sad, but it does not leave you depressed, rather, full of joy and hope!
