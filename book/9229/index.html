AND SPY AMERICA EVER PRODUCED.    "Wild Bill, as a frontier character of the daring, cunning and honorable class, stands alone, without a prototype; his originality is as conspicuous as his remarkable escapades. He was desperate without being a desperado; a fighter without that disposition which invites danger or craves the excitement of an encounter. He killed many men, but in every instance it was either in self-defense or in the prosecution of a duty which he deemed justifiable. Wild Bill was a necessary character in the Far West during the period which marked his career. He was essentially a civilizer, in the sense of a vigilance posse. The law and order class found in him an effective agent for the correction of the lawless; it was fighting the desperate with one of their kind, and Bill had the cunning to remain on the side of society and to always flank his enemies."   - Summary by from the book"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/0/items/lifeandadventuresofwildbillthescout_1502_librivox/life_and_adventures_of_wild_bill_1502.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Life and marvelous adventures of Wild Bill, the Scout</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/0/items/lifeandadventuresofwildbillthescout_1502_librivox/life_and_adventures_of_wild_bill_1502.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#07e1af;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/lifeandadventuresofwildbillthescout_1502_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
