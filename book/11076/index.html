In office and in the field they have labored strenuously, often affectionately, and always loyally, on my behalf. But for their interest some of the most cherished experiences of my life would have been beyond my reach. If sometimes in their zeal to keep me busy they have booked me in Winnipeg on Monday night, in New Orleans on Tuesday night, with little side-trips to San Diego, California, and Presque Isle, Maine, on Wednesday and Thursday, not to mention grand finales at Omaha and Key West on Friday and Saturday, I view that sequence rather as a tribute to my agility than as a matter to be unduly captious about. It is a manifestation of a confidence in my powers to overcome the limitations of time and space that I think upon with an expanding head, if not with a swelling heart, and whether this required annihilation of distance has been wholly agreeable or not it has enabled me to see more of my own country than I otherwise could have
seen, and to that extent, I hope, has made a better American of me.  - Summary from the author's preface"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/frompillartopost_1611_librivox/pillartopost_1611.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>From Pillar to Post</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/frompillartopost_1611_librivox/pillartopost_1611.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f1cbb4;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/frompillartopost_1611_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
