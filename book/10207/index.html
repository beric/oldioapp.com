During his lifetime he was known as the "Hoosier Poet" and "Children's Poet" for his dialect works and his children's poetry respectively. His poems tended to be humorous or sentimental, and of the approximately one thousand poems that Riley authored, the majority are in dialect. </p>

Riley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. </p>

Riley became a bestselling author in the 1890s. His children's poems were compiled into a book and illustrated by Howard Chandler Christy. Titled the Rhymes of Childhood, the book was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his own lifetime.  - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/8/items/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/In_Dark_1508.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>In The Dark</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/8/items/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox/In_Dark_1508.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#181a15;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/in_the_dark_1508.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
