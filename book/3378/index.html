Maynard Barbour's latest novel, called <i>At the Time Appointed</i>, and they will realize their expectations.The author has a certain way of forecasting events and making people utter prophetic words, all bound to find their fulfillment somewhere before the last chapter is ended, that is eminently characteristic of one who delights in the knitting and raveling of the intricate plots which are a prime necessity in a detective story.  The title itself cleverly suggests a long series of events slowly converging toward some mysteriously critical moment in which all their crookedness is revealed and made straight for the delectation of at least two people; and the is exactly the kind of a title for this story of long-delayed justice and patient hoping. The main object in a story of this kind is to make the events hang together and the narration of them entertaining.  Both these requisites are attained.  People will be sure to read this story at one sitting, even if that involves hearing the clock strike several times after midnight and that is one test of at least one kind of excellence in a novel."  (excerpts from the NY Times review of <i>At the Time Appointed</i> published July 18, 1903)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/at_the_time_appointed_1007_librivox/at_the_time_appointed_1012.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>At the Time Appointed</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/at_the_time_appointed_1007_librivox/at_the_time_appointed_1012.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d53e3b;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/at_the_time_appointed_1007_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
