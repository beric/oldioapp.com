This visit starts him on a string of adventures that find him getting charged by rhinoceroses, chased by African natives, and facing down a larger-than-life gorilla on his own. Of course, this is only the start of his adventure in to the land of the gorillas.
Please note: this book has some words now considered derogatory, which are used in a generic way without any derogatory meaning. At the time the book was written, these words were normal language. I have endeavored to read them as such--words that were perfectly suitable in the context of their day.
