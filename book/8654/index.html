Part 2 follows the journey of Christian's wife and sons as they follow him along the same path past the Slough of Despond, the Castle Despair and Vanity Fair.

This version was edited in 1909 by the Rev. Jesse Lyman Hurlbut to update some of the more archaic language and streamline the theological arguments to make them more accessible to lay readers. His aim was "not to re-write the Pilgrim's Progress, for that would destroy its greatest charm, but to change the words here and there to simpler ones... to make it plain and interesting". Dramatized with voices to distinguish the main characters, we hope to make this classic accessible to people of all ages. (Summary by Beth Thomas )
