Her world view is expressed in the title of her poem "Whatever Is—Is Best", suggesting an echo of Alexander Pope's "Whatever is, is right."

None of Wilcox's works were included by F. O. Matthiessen in The Oxford Book of American Verse, but Hazel Felleman chose no fewer than fourteen of her poems for Best Loved Poems of the American People, while Martin Gardner selected "The Way Of The World" and "The Winds of Fate" for Best Remembered Poems.

She is frequently cited in anthologies of bad poetry, such as The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse and Very Bad Poetry.  - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/23/items/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox/cuisine_1510.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Cuisine</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/23/items/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox/cuisine_1510.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_cuisine_1510.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
