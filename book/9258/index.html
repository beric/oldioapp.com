Widely considered a founding document of modern journalism, <i>The Storm</i> narrates the calamitous events of November 1703 that are framed by the author in the first four chapters.  These are followed by verbatim eyewitness accounts, solicited from survivors through a newspaper advertisement that Defoe placed shortly after the hurricane struck.  Defoe is primarily known for his later fiction, loosely based on historical calamities, such as his <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i> (1722), and by fictionalized novels purporting to be first-person accounts, including <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719) and <i>Moll Flanders </i>(1722).  It can be argued that <i>The Storm</i> was the journalistic crucible in which the master realist Defoe forged his later novelistic artistry, with its penchant for "the telling detail."  In fact, his fiction novel <i>The Plague Year</i> remains a required reading for journalism students to this day, side-by-side with the non-fiction account of  <i>The Storm</i>. –Denny Sayers </p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/32/items/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_1504.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Storm</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/32/items/the_storm_1504_librivox/storm_1504.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#393a58;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_storm_1504_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
