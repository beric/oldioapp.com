How? And why? That is what this beguiling tale of Kipling's sets out to tell us; how the local Huckley squire, Sir Thomas Ingell, having lured two newspaper proprietors, a reporter and an MP into committing a speeding violation, has the tables turned on him by their making his village (and, thereby, him) an international laughing stock - with the help of Bat Masquerier, music hall proprietor, example of The Totally Amoral Soul and Personal Devil (to quote one of his co-conspirators). The dancing of the Gubby, the totally imaginary Huckley village dance, in the Houses of Parliament serves as a climax and a high spot of the tale. This story can be found in the Kipling collection "A Diversity of Creatures".
