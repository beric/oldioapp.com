But we would leave a wrong impression if we gave it to be understood that all her time was passed in the writing of either poems or tales. Far from it. They constituted but one phase in a life nobly, yet unostentatiously, consecrated to the duties of home, of society, of charity and of religion. Mrs. Leprohon was much more than either a poet or a novelist—she was, also, in the highest sense, a woman, a lady. Had she never written a verse of poetry or a page of prose, she would still have been lovingly remembered for what she was as wife, as mother, as friend. (from the Introduction to The Poetical Works of Mrs. Leprohon (Miss R. E. Mullins))"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/3/items/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/canadiansummerevening_1708_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Canadian Summer Evening</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/3/items/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox/canadiansummerevening_1708_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/a_canadian_summer_evening_1708.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
