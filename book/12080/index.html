It will become obvious to the reader (and listener) of this (audio)book that Hannah Glasse was a very experienced and consummate cook totally focussed on preparing and presenting a wholesome and varied range of fare for the family and guests of the household in the most economic and efficient manner possible.

In the book’s foreword – ‘To The Reader’ - Hannah Glasse states that she has ‘not wrote in the high polite style’ but rather it is her intent to ‘instruct the lower sort’ in their own way. By writing in her practical no-nonsense manner she is able to instil confidence in anyone who follows her recipes and advice to be able to produce an almost infinite variety of meals using whatever ingredients are available at the time.

If you are looking for recipes for ‘Fancy Food’ then this book is not for you. But if you are interested in discovering how some of the best, wholesome, ‘stick to your ribs’ meals were created, then join me in the kitchen to find out what some of the finest 18th century British cuisine has to offer.
