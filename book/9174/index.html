In the meantime, Carter's friend Xodar has become the new Jeddak (chief or king) of the black Martian First Born, and those white Martian therns who reject the old religion likewise gain a new unnamed leader, but there are still some who wish to keep the old discredited religion going, including the therns' erstwhite leader, the Holy Hekkador Matai Shang. John Carter discovers that a First Born named Thurid knows the secret of the Temple of the Sun and he and Matai Shang want to rescue the Holy Thern's daughter Phaidor, who has been imprisoned with Dejah Thoris and another Barsoomian princess, Thuvia of Ptarth, in the Temple jail for several hundred days. Unfortunately, Thurid, to spite Carter, gets Matai Shang to also take Dejah Thoris and Thuvia along with them. Carter follows them in the hope of liberating his beloved wife. - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/30/items/warlordmars3_1409_librivox/warlordofmars3_1409.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Warlord of Mars (version 3)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/30/items/warlordmars3_1409_librivox/warlordofmars3_1409.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/warlordmars3_1409_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
