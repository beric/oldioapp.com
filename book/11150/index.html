He was known as a novelist, essayist, short story writer, critic and poet. He wrote both supernatural fiction and some children's literature.  "Mice & Other Poems" is one of a series of small volumes of poetry published after WWI mostly by graduates of the University of Cambridge.  The doyen of "Cambridge English", Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, had this to say about the series:  "That since the War, young men in extraordinary numbers have taken to expressing themselves in verse is a plain fact, not to be denied: that they choose, as often as not, to express themselves in 'numbers' extraordinary to us can as hardly be contested. But the point is, they have a crowding impulse to say something; and to say it with the emotional seriousness proper to Poetry. For my part, I love the discipline of verse: but I love the impulse better. Time will soften—I hope not too soon, lest it sugar down and sentimentalise—a certain bitterness of resentment observable in this booklet and its next followers: but, as nothing in verse is nobler than true tradition, anything is more hopeful than convention." - Summary by John Burlinson"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/32/items/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/mice_1609.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Mice & Other Poems</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/32/items/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox/mice_1609.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e0cda3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/mice_other_poems_jb_1609_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
