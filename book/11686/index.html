He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. His works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. Donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. These features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional Elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into English of European baroque and mannerist techniques.  - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/mistressbed_1703.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>To His Mistress Going to Bed</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/download/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox/mistressbed_1703.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/to_his_mistress_going_to_bed_1702.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
