Jerome, R. L. Stevenson, Bret Harte, Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling, Conan Doyle and Mary Braddon. Full of charm, humour and pathos, this book is like a fireside chat with great writers of the past, as well as being a fascinating insight into the literary scene of the late 19th century.The listener is warned that a few of the authors give away the ending of their book, especially when they were pressurised into changing it by the publisher..Here are links to online texts of the works discussed, where available: Ready-Money Mortiboy;
