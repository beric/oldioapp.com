It is also when we are introduced to her most famous of detectives, Fleming Stone.
<br /><br />
On the eve of her wedding day, Madeleine Van Norman, a beautiful young lady who is soon to come into her family fortune is found dead, apparently stabbed with an ominous blood-stained letter opener found nearby. There is nobody within the household who is not considered a suspect by the police, but how could a killer have slipped through the doors of Madeleine’s locked bedroom? It must have been suicide, as a note was found lying on a table near her body. Or was it? An intriguing mystery ensues which hinges on the discovery of a single, all-important clue. - Summary by Roger Melin <br /><br />"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/theclue_1711_librivox/clue_1711_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Clue</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/theclue_1711_librivox/clue_1711_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d29a69;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/theclue_1711_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
