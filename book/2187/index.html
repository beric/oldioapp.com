Lucy" /><meta name="og:description" content="<br /><em>Faces and Places</em> is a collection of articles on nineteenth century travel, events and personalities by the British journalist Henry Lucy, who wrote for the Daily News, a London newspaper. His open letter <em>To Those About to Become Journalists</em> rings as true today as when it was written.<br /><br />The first article, <em>"Fred" Burnaby</em>, includes a lively account of a balloon trip, while <em>Night and Day on the Cars in Canada</em> and <em>Easter on Les Avants</em> relate Lucy's experiences of rail travel at that time. Other travel tales (<em>A Night on a Mountain</em>, <em>Mosquitoes and Monaco</em>, and <em>Oysters and Arcachon</em>) provide an insight into the Victorian Englishman's attitude to Europe.<br /><br />Three of the pieces, <em>With Peggotty and Ham</em>, <em>A Cinque Port</em> and <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's</em>, concern the county of Kent, where Lucy had a country house. <em>Christmas Eve at Watts's</em> contains an interesting exposé of Dickens' short story <em>The Seven Poor Travellers</em>.<br /><br />Other articles are of historical interest: <em>A Wreck in the North Sea</em> is an account of the wreck of the ship "Deutschland" in 1875; <em>A Historic Crowd</em> describes the massive popular interest in the 1871 trial of the Tichborne Claimant; <em>The Battle of Merthyr</em> contains an eye-witness account of the Merthyr Riots of 1831; <em>The Prince of Wales</em> paints a portrait of the future King Edward VII.<br /><br />Lucy, who also wrote as "Toby, M.P." for the satirical magazine Punch, loved to poke gentle fun, particularly at the establishment, and this is especially evident in <em>A Peep at an Old House of Commons</em> and <em>Some Preachers I Have Known</em>.<br /><br />This eclectic collection, mostly affectionately humorous, but with moments of great pathos, was originally published in 1892 in The Whitefriars Library of Wit & Humour.(Summary by Ruth Golding)<br /><br />"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/faces_places_rg_librivox/Faces_Places_1112.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Faces and Places</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/faces_places_rg_librivox/Faces_Places_1112.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#131418;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/faces_places_rg_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
