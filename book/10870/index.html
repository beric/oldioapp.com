<br><br>
Similar to his novels, the underlying themes of the majority of the poems in this collection are death, departure and unfulfilled love, while the central piece is comprised of the 15 short "Satires of Circumstance," funny poems with a bittersweet touch.
<br><br>
The poems have been recorded by our trio of readers John Burlinson, Tomas Peter and Sonia. As an interesting touch, some poems can be considered short dramatic readings, and as such have been performed as dialogues."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/0/items/satires_of_circumstance_1710_librivox/satiresofcircumstance_1710_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Satires of Circumstance, Lyrics and Reveries, with Miscellaneous Pieces</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/0/items/satires_of_circumstance_1710_librivox/satiresofcircumstance_1710_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e9e5e6;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/satires_of_circumstance_1710_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
