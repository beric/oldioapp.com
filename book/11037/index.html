His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century, and he is now often considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets. His biographer Jonathan Bate states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self". - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/the_flood_1607.poem_librivox/flood_clare_1607.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Flood</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/the_flood_1607.poem_librivox/flood_clare_1607.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#272727;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_flood_1607.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
