He is often careless about accuracy.  Numberless incongruities can be pointed out.  He is as willing to adopt an anachronism as a medieval painter.  I would defy an historian to reconstruct the battle of Austerlitz from Count Tolstoy's description.  And yet what a picture of a battle was ever more vivid!  It is like a painting where the general impression is true, but a close analysis discovers nothing but contradictory lines!What a succession -- a kaleidoscopic succession of life-views, he gives in "War and Peace!"  One follows the other without confusion, naturally, with entrancing interest. "The court and camp, town and country, nobles and peasants, -- all are sketched in with the same broad and sure outline.  We pass at a leap from a soiree to a battle-field, from a mud hovel to a palace, from an idyl to a saturnalia.  As we summon our recollections of the prodigal outpouring of a careless genius, a troop of characters as lifelike as any in Scott or in Shakespeare, defile before our mental eye.  Tolstoy finds endless opportunities of inculcating his favorite themes: -- the mastery of circumstance over will and desire, the weakness of man in the front of things, and the necessity for resignation."
