In 1865, he was appointed archbishop of Westminster, which is the mother diocese of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, and in 1875, was made a cardinal by Pope Pius IX.<br><br>Sin and Its Consequences is based on a series of eight Lenten lectures. The first four chapters deal with the problem of sin. After explaining the nature sin, Manning explains the distinction between mortal and venial sins. He further discusses sins of omission which, if left unchecked, can all too easily lead to more serious sins. In the fifth chapter, Manning shows how the Sacrament of Penance is a most effective remedy for actual sins committed after Baptism. He gives practical advice for avoiding the occasions that lead to sin and illustrates how Jesus Himself overcame temptations during His earthly life. Finally, he describes the joys that await those who sincerely repent and conform their wills to the divine will, for those who live and die in solidarity with Jesus Christ, shall rise with Him to everlasting life and glory.
