In this novel two months have gone by and Tarzan is continuing to search for Jane. He has tracked her to a hidden valley called Pal-ul-don, which means "Land of Men." In Pal-ul-don Tarzan finds a real Jurassic Park filled with dinosaurs, notably the savageTriceratops-like Gryfs, which unlike their prehistoric counterparts are carnivorous. The lost valley is also home to two different races of tailed human-looking creatures, the Ho-don (hairless and white skinned) and the Waz-don (hairy and black-skinned). Tarzan befriends Ta-den, a Ho-don warrior, and Om-at, the Waz-don chief of the tribe of Kor-ul-ja. In this new world he becomes a captive but so impresses his captors with his accomplishments and skills that they name him Tarzan-Jad-Guru (Tarzan the Terrible), which is the name of the novel (Introduction by Wikipedia)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/34/items/tarzantheterrible_1112_librivox/Tarzan_Terrible_1112.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Tarzan the Terrible</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/34/items/tarzantheterrible_1112_librivox/Tarzan_Terrible_1112.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#6d7441;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/tarzantheterrible_1112_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
