The events of the story occur on the coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, and on the Mississippi River. The volume and the series close with the return of the hero, by a route not often taken by tourists, to his home in Michigan. His voyaging on the ocean, the Great Lakes, and the Father of Waters, is finished for the present; but the writer believes that his principal character has grown wiser and better since he was first introduced to the reader. He has made mistakes of judgment, but whatever of example and inspiration he may impart to the reader will be that of a true and noble boy, with no vices to disfigure his character, and no low aims to lead him from "the straight and narrow path" of duty.Dorchester, Mass., June 1, 1881(Introduction by Author)This book was written under the pseudonym of Oliver Optic."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/14/items/up_the_river_1108_librivox/upriver_1108.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Up the River</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/14/items/up_the_river_1108_librivox/upriver_1108.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#fbfbfb;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/up_the_river_1108_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
