Cheerful and ever-optimistic, Pollyanna sets out to infect the whole town with her "Glad" game, getting into some trouble along the way! How will strict Miss Polly react to the orphaned cat, dog, and, worst of all, BOY Pollyanna offers as a gift? What will happen when Pollyanna sets out to break into the fairy-tale castle next door and play the Glad game with the "Beautiful King" - or lonely old hermit - closeted inside? What is the great secret that Miss Polly, the hermit, and his friend seem to be keeping? And how will Pollyanna and her friends cope with a great tragedy that seems to forever wipe out all reason for being glad?
