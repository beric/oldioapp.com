And never—NEVER—in her fourteen or so years' experience had she been blown up by a mountain spring. But there comes, in every one's experience a day which is unlike every other day, and so it was with the Goat Girl. As she was pursuing What-a-butter, her favorite goat, there was a sudden crash, a whish, and up flew the slab of rock on which she was standing, up and away.

The adventures into which she was carried by this simple though awefull beginning take a whole book to relate. How she met Nox the Royal Ox of Keretaria, how together they went in search of little King Kerry, how at last they rescued him and found themselves feted guests of Ozma of Oz, all these things you must read for yourselves.   - Summary by the author and Phil chenevert"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/handymandyinoz_1801_librivox/handy_mandy_oz_1801_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Handy Mandy in Oz</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/handymandyinoz_1801_librivox/handy_mandy_oz_1801_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#014076;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/handymandyinoz_1801_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
