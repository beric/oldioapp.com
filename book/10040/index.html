Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.
Poe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields, such as cosmology and cryptography. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. - Summary by Wikipedia</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/2/items/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/lake_1507.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Lake</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/2/items/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox/lake_1507.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#1b0000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_lake_1507.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
