He was born on November 28, 1873, in Kovno, Lithuania; he died on November 11, 1953, in New York City. Ginzberg taught at the Jewish Theological seminary from 1903 to 1953. For 50 years, he trained two generations of Conservative Rabbis.The Legends of the Jews is an epic 7-volume compilation of traditional Jewish stories loosely related to the Bible. Over the millenia, these stories, which expand on the Bible, flesh out the lives of biblical figures. In the process, they help bring to life the Bible's valuable lessons.The Legends of the Jews has been called a monumental work of scholarship. It is studied by serious students of both Judaism and Christianity. And yet the stories continue to be accessible and understood by all. They were designed to impart lessons of the Torah, and any child or adult will find much to enjoy about this work.(Summary by Scott Sherris and Wikipedia)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/legendsjews_v2_0809_librivox/Legends_Jews_Vol2_1201.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Legends of the Jews, Volume 2</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/legendsjews_v2_0809_librivox/Legends_Jews_Vol2_1201.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/legendsjews_v2_0809_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
