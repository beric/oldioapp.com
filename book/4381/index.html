The factory was abandoned, and following the habits of small towns, the space between the dock and the shore became "The Cinder Pond." Jean started life in the colony of squatters that came to live in the shanties on the dock, but fortune, heroism, and a mystery combine to change her fortunes and those of her friends near the Cinder Pond. (Advertising material from the publisher, 1915)</p><p>More than one girl who reads this story will envy Jeanne her queer little home out on the end of the old dock in Lake Superior. It must indeed have been a fascinating place to live, but Jeanne's father, a gentleman himself, wanted her to grow up to be a lady, so she was sent away to be trained and educated among strangers. They were her own relatives, but they could never be anything but strangers to her, for they had no love in their hearts for the little girl who had come to make a home with them. Only her grandfather learned to love her, for she filled a bright place in his lonely life, and the story tells how he showed his feeling for her and how she was able to go back to Cinder Pond to help her little stepbrothers and -sisters. (<i>Book Review Digest</i>, vol. 11, 1916)</p><p>An interesting story of a little French girl, who lived with her step-family on a dock near the Cinder Pond and who after several trying experiences finds a good home and real joy in helping care for her several step-brothers and sisters. Though reason for the marriage of Jeannette's father to a shiftless, but kindly Irish woman is unnecessarily emphasized, the story is a very usable one, stamped with Jeanne's friendliness and sincerity. (<i>The Booklist</i>, vol 12, Oct. 1915--July, 1916)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/3/items/cinder_pond_bb_librivox/cinder_pond_1212.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Cinder Pond</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/3/items/cinder_pond_bb_librivox/cinder_pond_1212.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#4e6da3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/cinder_pond_bb_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
