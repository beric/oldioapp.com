Though some of the articles appear redundant, they were selected to represent a contemporary view spanning five years of the organization's early popularity (1917-1921). Of significance are the detailed descriptions of Girl Scout involvement in war work during what is now known as World War I. Girl Scouts were prepared through their training for merit badges to be independent, resourceful, reliable, and helpful. They were able to make their own clothes, grow and cook their own food, care for the sick, and start a small business--skills that prepared young women for their future roles as homemakers, workers, and citizens.A version of the story "The Brownies" is still part of the Brownie Girl Scout literature into the 21st century. The Encyclopaedia and Dictionary of Education edited by Foster Watson (1921) provides the following explanation under the entry for "Girl Guides": "The 'Brownies' are children under 11, who take two promises only, and whose motto is 'Lend a hand.' The scheme is based on Mrs. Ewing's story of the 'Brownies.'"Though not an official Girl Scout story, The Tadger Tales have become a tradition with many Girl Scout summer camp programs. The stories are read aloud and acted out with improvisation and much silliness. The event concludes with a secret Tadger club ritual involving a safety pin, some tape, and a bit of string."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/28/items/girl_scout_collection_1008_blb_librivox/Girl_Scout_Collection_1210.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Girl Scout Collection</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/28/items/girl_scout_collection_1008_blb_librivox/Girl_Scout_Collection_1210.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/girl_scout_collection_1008_blb_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
