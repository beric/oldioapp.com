Of course you probably know these delightful children from their earlier adventures with magic, Bernard, Mavis, Kathleen, and Francis.  Just normal children who believe in the fun of imagining and of magic.   In this story Francis, who has always loved the idea of the sea but has never actually seen it, is very excited about going to the seashore for holiday.   He finds an old aquarium and the others help him lug it home only to have their hopes dashed by Aunt Enid who was in charge temporarily.  But then the magic starts when he unwittingly recites a magic charm.   At the seashore the children execute a daring rescue of a supposed mermaid who 'die in captivity' and oh, lots and lots more.  Enjoy these adventurous children and their wet magic in the sea.     - Summary by Phil chenevert"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/2/items/wet_magic_1512_librivox/wetmagic_1601.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Wet Magic</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/2/items/wet_magic_1512_librivox/wetmagic_1601.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/wet_magic_1512_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
