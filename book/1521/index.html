His works, notable for their realistic and sensual style, include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and immediacy of metaphor, compared with that of his contemporaries. Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many men, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, from which come the famous lines “Death, be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.” (Summary from Wikipedia) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/35/items/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/Holy_Sonnets_1110.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Holy Sonnets</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/35/items/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox/Holy_Sonnets_1110.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#14171c;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/holy_sonnets_drb_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
