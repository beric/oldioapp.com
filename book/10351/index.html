Think there is such a thing as corrupt rich guys who pretend they're God's gift to the world? So did Swift. Think some of these types strut around as if calls of nature don't apply to them? So did Swift. In one hilarious poem, he even describes gold diggers fighting over the loaded gentleman's gaseous offerings! His poem On Poetry, A Rhapsody, censored for treasonous mocking of the royal family, is in its rare uncensored form here. As free as he himself is with his sharp tongue against the blackened rich and corrupt , he knows others might have to kiss up to eat. So he includes many verses of advice on how to go about lying for a living, for example, "Your interest lies to learn the knack Of whitening what before was black." Despite the decay and hypocrisy he sees all around him he stays upbeat throughout -- even making fun out of his own tragic onset of deafness. You already know this giant of English literature for the great feast of prose he left us. Think of these delicious poems here as your sinful dessert. - Summary by Arthur Krolman "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/25/items/poemsofswiftvolumeone_1512_librivox/poems_jonathon_swift1_1512.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Poems of Jonathan Swift, Volume One</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/25/items/poemsofswiftvolumeone_1512_librivox/poems_jonathon_swift1_1512.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffebd2;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/poemsofswiftvolumeone_1512_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
