The Great Khan.  This was a man born Temujin to a clan leader father who was later poisoned.  The family was left unprotected and without power to fend for themselves on the Eurasian Steppe.  Genghis later rose to power and founded the Mongol Empire, one of the largest in all of history.  Despite his great achievement and ferocious reputation there is much we do not know of him, even what he looked like.  Historians state that there is not a single portrait of the man that survives to the present day.  All current renditions are done after his death by people who never knew him.  His death is recorded and his entombment discussed...but all remains to be found.
