Giles is engaged to the wealthy Daisy, yet is clearly in love with the governess Anne Denham. Things come to a head when Daisy is murdered. Who would murder her? Perhaps the governess who told her she would kill her and made it clear she wanted to exchange places with her? After all the governess ran away with a mysterious man right after the murder and was not seen again. Or did someone frame the governess? Perhaps it is Mr. Morley, Daisy's guardian, who wanted her money? Or perhaps someone else? After all, Daisy was not popular in the village. Giles, bent on saving the woman he loves, and the detective Mr. Steel go to investigate. This is a detective story in the traditional sense, but it is a host of other things. It is a very strong love story, a story about class and how it influences people's choices, a story about greed, and much more. - Summary by Stav Nisser."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/10/items/coinofedwardvii_1712_librivox/coin_edward_1712_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Coin Of Edward VII</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/10/items/coinofedwardvii_1712_librivox/coin_edward_1712_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#63dad6;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/coinofedwardvii_1712_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
