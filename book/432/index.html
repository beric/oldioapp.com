<p>Written in 1922, <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em>, or, <em>How Toys Become Real</em> is the tale of a sweet unassuming toy rabbit who questions what it is to live and to love. It was the first children's title written by Margery Williams (1881 - 1944), who had previously created only for adults. This story eclipsed all others, to become her most famous work, and an ever adored classic for all ages. (Summary written by Marlo Dianne)</p>
<p><em>"It was by a sort of accident that The Velveteen Rabbit became the beginning of all the stories I have written since…By thinking about toys and remembering toys, they suddenly become very much alive. Toys I had loved as a little girl--my almost forgotten Tubby, who was the rabbit, and Old Dobbin, the Skin Horse, and the toys my children had loved."</em> -- Margery Williams
