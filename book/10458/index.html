Torn from their native land, their friends and homes, they were sold in the markets of Carolina and Georgia. Feeling the hand of oppression bearing heavily upon them, they fled to Florida, and, under Spanish laws, became free. … At a time of profound peace, our army, acting under the direction of the Executive, invaded Florida, murdered many of these free men, and brought others to the United States and consigned them to slavery. An expensive and bloody war followed …During its protracted continuance of seven years, bribery and treachery were practiced towards the Exiles and their allies, the Seminole Indians; flags of truce were violated; the pledged faith of the nation was disregarded. By these means the removal of the Exiles from Florida was effected. After they had settled in the Western Country, most of these iniquities were repeated, until they were driven from our nation and compelled to seek an asylum in Mexico.” (From the author’s Introduction, 1858)</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/30/items/exiles_of_florida_gg_mk_1603_librivox/exilesofflorida_1603.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Exiles of Florida</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/30/items/exiles_of_florida_gg_mk_1603_librivox/exilesofflorida_1603.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#cfbfae;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/exiles_of_florida_gg_mk_1603_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
