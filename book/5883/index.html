Henry, influenced by the hated Thomas Cromwell, fell into opposition with them, suppressing them, and closing religious houses. In that period a famous shrine, erected centuries earlier at Walsingham and dedicated to our Lady, drew people from far and near for it was a favorite place of pilgrimage and the site of many miracles.<br><br>On their grandmother's and uncle's farm, far removed from this scene of persecution, were Jemmy Reynolds and his sister Joan. For a long time they had been promised the chance to make the pilgrimage to Walsingham, and now at last they were going. Their biggest problem was to find a suitable offering to our Lady, and Joan came upon the idea of presenting a great, fine candle. And so they set out upon a thrilling journey which eventually brings Jem face to face with the crafty Cromwell and King Henry himself.<br><br>What happens when they meet a cunning stranger on the way to the shrine and later when Jem attempts to rescue a friend from Cromwell's power are some of the exciting developments that make A Candle For Our Lady interesting and fast moving. True history and authentic background are woven into this story which provides a taste of the struggles English Catholics knew in a time when cruelty and greed ruled the land.
