As she explains in the first story, they were told her by her grandmother "I remember that grandmother told story after story from morning till night, and that we children sat beside her, quite still, and listened. It was a glorious life! No other children had such happy times as we did.   It isn’t much that I recollect about my grandmother. I remember that she had very beautiful snow-white hair, and stooped when she walked, and that she always sat and knitted a stocking.   And I even remember that when she had finished a story, she used to lay her hand on my head and say: “All this is as true, as true as that I see you and you see me.”   - Summary by Phil chenevert"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/12/items/christlegends_1607_librivox/christ_legends_1608.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Christ Legends</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/12/items/christlegends_1607_librivox/christ_legends_1608.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#254e7c;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/christlegends_1607_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
