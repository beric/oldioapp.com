The first nine sections, “The Story of a Country House”, is a short Novel, originally published on its own, but here part of the collection.
It is the story of how a young orphan girl, Ingrid, is the instrument of saving the student Gunnar Hede, who has lost his wits and memory by a terrible experience, trying to save his home, his Couyntry House, and who wanders the roads as a Pedlar, but at the same time afraid of most everything, especially animals. As told by Lagerloef it is a both fascinating and sweet story, as are all the others.
