Two poems of medium length in this collection:

#04 "Copernicus" (13:38) is from the volume "Watchers of the Sky" by Alfred Noyes.

#12 "A Joyful Meditation of the Coronation of King Henry the Eighth" (14:12). The original text was published as an eight-page pamphlet. In the surviving copy, the bottoms of the pages have been cropped. A total of three lines are therefore missing, and a further three have been reconstructed from their surviving portions. The html version of the poem shows these reconstructions. This poem has been read using modern English pronunciation. Some words have no modern equivalent, including such words as encensing, entenderment, soote, boote, withouten, inuentions, contrarious, and minnish which is short for dimminish.
Emyspery = hemisphere.
Quayre (quire) = an eight-page printed booklet.
Tene = harm, injury or hurt.
Rother = rudder
The "monk of bery" was John Lydgate of Bury St. Edmunds (c. 1370 - c. 1451) a monk and poet."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/20/items/spc142_1504_librivox/spc142.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Short Poetry Collection 142</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/20/items/spc142_1504_librivox/spc142.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#653332;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/spc142_1504_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
