So he was just the man to be chosen king of the fairies..."   George MacDonald (December 10, 1824 – September 18, 1905) was a Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister.  Though no longer well known, his works (particularly his fairy tales and fantasy novels) have inspired admiration in such notables as W. H. Auden, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L'Engle.  The Shadows is one such fairy tale.  The strange Shadows spend their existence casting themselves upon the walls and forming pictures of various sorts: mimicking evil actions of those who have done wrong in the hopes of causing their repentance, playing a comic dumb-show to inspire a playwright and dancing to inspire a musician, nudging a little girl to comfort her grandfather, and playing with a sick little boy as he waits for his mother to return home.  The king privately pities the Shadows, for they cannot generally remember their deeds, acquaintances, or loves past a single night.
