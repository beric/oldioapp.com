This is a love that so many of our forefathers have found and even now enjoy, but which so many of us still seek. The American Jesuit Father Cassilly opens our eyes to this love, the unifying and personal love between the human person and his Creator. He shows how this ultimate love is the basis of all true love that we experience and how this love, which introduces itself at the beginning of our lives and faithfully endures throughout our lives, awaits us in its fullness at the end of our earthly pilgrimage.
