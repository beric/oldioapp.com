In it, he shows how throughout Scripture, in the life of every saint, and that of God’s own Son, and all through Church history, God is, first of all, a prayer-hearing God. He builds upon the truths brought out in his earlier volume “With Christ in the School of Prayer”, by showing firstly that Christ meant prayer to be the great power by which His Church should do its work, and secondly that we have far too little conception of the place that intercession, as opposed to praying just for our own needs, should have in the Church and in the Christian life. The book concludes with some very helpful practical guidelines on intercession. - Summary by Christopher Smith"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/30/items/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/Ministry_Intercession_1402.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Ministry of Intercession</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/30/items/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox/Ministry_Intercession_1402.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#d5b586;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/ministryofintercession_1401_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
