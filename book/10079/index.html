These are usually little more than rooms, with walls made of small panes of glass. The furniture consists of a tripod with a contrivance for holding the kettle, and a fire to keep the coffee boiling. A carpeted bench traverses the entire length of the room. This is occupied by turbaned Turks, their legs folded under them, smoking nargilehs or chibooks or cigarettes, and sipping coffee. A few will be engaged in a game of backgammon, but the majority enter into conversation, at first only in syllables, which gradually gives rise to a general discussion. Finally, some sage of the neighborhood comes in, and the company appeals to him to settle the point at issue. This he usually does by telling a story to illustrate his opinion. Some of the stories told on these occasions are adaptations of those already known in Arabic and Persian literature, but the Turkish mind gives them a new setting and a peculiar philosophy. They are characteristic of the habits, customs, and methods of thought of the people, and for this reason seem worthy of preservation. - Summary by Preface</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/23/items/told_in_the_coffee_house_1508_librivox/toldincoffeehouse_1508.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Told in the Coffee House</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/23/items/told_in_the_coffee_house_1508_librivox/toldincoffeehouse_1508.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e4dda6;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/told_in_the_coffee_house_1508_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
