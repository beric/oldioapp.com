She gained minor recognition, but no financial stability, through local magazines. Published posthumously by friends in 1910, four years after French's suicide, <i>Poems by Nora May French</i> was the first and only compilation of her works until 2009.<br>

Although many of her poems celebrate the serenity of coastal landscape, others are less sanguine. They offer glimpses into the mind of a young woman plagued by heartbreak and torn between pressure to submit to social roles and longing to live creatively. The most famous poem in the collection, <i>The Spanish Girl</i>, reflects on a failed engagement, the first of many. - Summary by Mary Kay</p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/1/items/poems_1504_librivox/poems_1504.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Poems</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/1/items/poems_1504_librivox/poems_1504.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#483d27;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/poems_1504_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
