Flandrau" /><meta name="og:description" content=""It has been a little over fifty years since the organization of the Territory of Minnesota, which at its birth was a very small and unimportant creation, but which in its half century of growth has expanded into one of the most brilliant and promising stars upon the union of our flag; so that its history must cover every subject, moral, physical and social, that enters into the composition of a first-class progressive Western state, which presents a pretty extensive field; but there is also to be considered a period anterior to civilization, which may be called the aboriginal and legendary era, which abounds with interesting matter, and to the general reader is much more attractive than the prosy subjects of agriculture, finance and commerce."

"Having lived in the state through nearly the whole period of Minnesota's political existence, and having taken part in most of the leading events in her history, both savage and civilized, I propose to treat the various subjects that compose her history in a narrative and colloquial manner that may not rise to the dignity of history, but which, I think, while giving facts, will not detract [2]from the interest or pleasure of the reader. If I should in the course of my narrative so far forget myself as to indulge in a joke, or relate an illustrative anecdote, the reader must put up with it." - Summary by Judge Charles E. Flandrau, from the Opening Statement"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/9/items/history_minnesota_part1_1604_librivox/history_of_minnesota_tales_of_the_frontier_1604.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>History of Minnesota and Tales of the Frontier, Part 1</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/9/items/history_minnesota_part1_1604_librivox/history_of_minnesota_tales_of_the_frontier_1604.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#f4c923;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/history_minnesota_part1_1604_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
