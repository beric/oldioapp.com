The Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition was a world's fair held in Seattle in 1909, publicizing the development of the Pacific Northwest.  The fairgrounds became the campus of the University of Washington.  The fairground’s design (by the Olmstead brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmstead, designer of Central Park, New York) strongly influenced the subsequent physical development of the campus.  Visitors numbered 3,700,000.  This is the report of the commissioners responsible for California’s exhibit.
