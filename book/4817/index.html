This gave rise to a public dispute between the US Government and the United Nations about the level of fatalities caused by the attack and about whether those killed had been civilians or Taliban-linked insurgents. Allegations soon emerged that the attack had been based on false information deliberately fed to the US military by Afghan employees of ArmorGroup, a private security contractor, and that these employees were engaged in murder and anti-coalition activities. A key local contact of ArmorGroup, who they dubbed "Mr Pink", was subsequently convicted of espionage and sentenced to death, but was later freed."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/28/items/private_security_contractors_1201_librivox/report_private_security_contractors_afghanistan_1210.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Report of the Inquiry into the Role and Oversight of Private Security Contractors in Afghanistan</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/28/items/private_security_contractors_1201_librivox/report_private_security_contractors_afghanistan_1210.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/private_security_contractors_1201_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
