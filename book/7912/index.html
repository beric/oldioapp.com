He was a child prodigy who learned playing chess simply by watching family members play, and when he was only 9 years old, he was hailed as the best chess player in New Orleans. <br>
This book describes Morphy's trip to Europe, i.e., England and France, where he wanted to play the European Champion Staunton, a match that never came about as the correspondence included in this book shows. He did play - and beat - virtually every other strong player in Europe though, and tales of these matches and people make up a large part of this book. After his triumphs in Europe, Paul Morphy was considerd the unofficial World Chess Champion, as official championship tournaments were only held from 1886. 
<br>
Morphy retired from chess in 1859 in order to devote himself to his law practice. He died from a stroke in 1884.
