The Little Lady is four years old, going on five, and is fond of stories. This makes her and the Story Teller good friends. They mostly sit in the firelight after supper, and while the Little Lady is being undressed they tell each other all that has happened since morning. Then the Little Lady looks into the fire and says:—

"Now, tell me a story."

Sometimes she wants a new story. Sometimes one of the old ones, which must be told always the same, because the Little Lady, like a good many grown up people, does not care for new and revised editions, but wants the old stories in the old words, that sound real and true. Sometimes the Story Teller forgets or improves on his plots, but the Little Lady never forgets and never fails to set the Story Teller right."  - Summary by the author"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/13/items/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollow_tree_1710_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Hollow Tree and Deep Woods Book</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/13/items/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox/hollow_tree_1710_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#000000;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/hollowtreedeepwoodsbook_1710_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
