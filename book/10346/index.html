Mr. Dooley was a saloonkeeper with opinions on most everything in his day, political or not. His pronouncements found their mark often as not in the White House, and President Theodore Roosevelt would begin his cabinet meetings with readings of Mr. Dooley's thoughts for the day. Of course, Mr. Dooley was entirely fictional, but his keen wit and insight were as relevant as any put forth by, say, Finley Peter Dunne, that penner of satirical essays. (summary by Don W. Jenkins) "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/2/items/dooleyinpeaceandwar_1607_librivox/mr_dooley_1607.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/2/items/dooleyinpeaceandwar_1607_librivox/mr_dooley_1607.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ebece7;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/dooleyinpeaceandwar_1607_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
