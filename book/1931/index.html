As the scientists begin experimentation on some chicks, the substance is misused by some “country folk” who don’t take it seriously and soon Herakleophorbia IV is running rampant throughout England and then across the globe, creating giant plants and animals that wreak havoc on the land and then the people. Then the first giant babies are revealed and for the first time humanity has to contend with the existence of a new race of giant people. How humanity deals with this shocking new creation is revealed in The Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth. (Summary by Alex C. Telander)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/3/items/food_of_the_gods_act/Food_of_the_Gods_1009.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/3/items/food_of_the_gods_act/Food_of_the_Gods_1009.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#ffffff;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/food_of_the_gods_act" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
