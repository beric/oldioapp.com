The story's themes of economic inequality between producers and consumers, political collusion within the upper classes, and the loss of the middle class ring particularly true today, especially in a global context. Billed as a "romance of the future," the plot of this fictional account of class struggle between workingmen and trust magnates of the new industrial economy hinges on a unique electric machine, which did not exist in 1905, but is quite common today. Besides writing at least four books, the author was a prolific poet and frequent contributor to the International Socialist Review. He corresponded with a variety of personalities, including the poet Edwin Markham, labor leaders Theodore and Eugene Debs, controversial activist and minister George D. Herron, and writer Samuel Clemens. - Summary by Andru Bemis"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/23/items/recordingangel_1610_librivox/recording_angel_1610.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Recording Angel</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/23/items/recordingangel_1610_librivox/recording_angel_1610.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#cac9c5;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/recordingangel_1610_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
