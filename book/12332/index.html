In this novel, the The Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece and Rome had returned to Earth—with all their awesome powers intact, and Earth was transformed almost overnight. War on any scale was outlawed, along with boom-and-bust economic cycles, and ...er... prudery—no change was more startling than the face of New York, where, for instance, the Empire State Building became the Tower of Zeus!  Our hero, William Forrester is an acolyte of Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and therefore a teacher, but Maya Wilson, girl student, was a worshiper of Venus, Goddess of Love and she definitely has  different ideas of what to do after class with your professor, especially in a world where prudery has been outlawed.   Much dilly-dallying, spooning and downright shenanigans occur I am sad to say but the plot may thicken in the end.   - Summary by Phil chenevert and the author"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/35/items/paganpassions_1710_librivox/pagan_passions_1709_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Pagan Passions</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/35/items/paganpassions_1710_librivox/pagan_passions_1709_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#5c91a3;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/paganpassions_1710_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
