Is he mean or evil? Quite the opposite: He does nothing wrong, hurts no one and wants only to be liked and to help, yet he seems to be blamed for every accident that ever happens to anyone in the University research facility where he 'works' as a porter. Why does disaster seem to swirl around him like a tornado whips around it's eye. He never is hurt in the slightest way while others slash themselves with previously innocent knives, are smashed by falling bookcases that had no cause to fall, and are shot by guns that are safely tucked away. And of course when he enters the army, with it's concentrated availability of destructive equipment, the situation only seems to get worse. Why? Listen to this delightful tale of future wars and a secret weapon named Dolliver Wims and how he may be the key to world peace. Or perhaps it's the other way around ....
