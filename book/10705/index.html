Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre. Widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and American literature as a whole, he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/11/items/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox/Sleeper_1603.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Sleeper</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/11/items/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox/Sleeper_1603.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#47444f;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/the_sleeper_1603.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
