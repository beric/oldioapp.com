The first is to create or to encourage in every student the desire to read the best books, and to know literature itself rather than what has been written about literature. The second is to interpret literature both personally and historically, that is, to show how a great book generally reflects not only the author's life and thought but also the spirit of the age and the ideals of the nation's history. The third aim is to show, by a study of each successive period, how our literature has steadily developed from its first simple songs and stories to its present complexity in prose and poetry.

Long)<p>"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/31/items/english_literature_1310_librivox/english_literature_1311.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>English Literature: Its History and Its Significance for the Life of the English Speaking World</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/31/items/english_literature_1310_librivox/english_literature_1311.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#858970;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/english_literature_1310_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
