While many of these came by letter form other churches, many of them were new converts and had had practically no systematic instruction in the fundamental truths of the Christina faith, so we announced a series of sermons on The Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith.  There was immediately a large increase in the attendance at the services where these addresses were given, and this increase has kept up until on the last Lord's Day we had much the largest attendance we have ever had, excepting Easter Sunday. Many have testified to the blessing received form these sermons, and there has been a great demand that the sermons be printed for general circulation.  It is hoped that this volume will be useful to other pastors in suggesting lines of teaching in their regular pastoral work, and also that it may be used widely by pastors and others for circulation among Christians.  We live in a day in which many of our church members are all at sea as to what they believe on the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith.  These sermons have already helped many through their delivery.  It is hoped they will reach and help far more in the printed form.  (R. A. Torrey)"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/27/items/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentals_1710_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Faith</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/27/items/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox/fundamentals_1710_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#35648e;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/fundamentaldoctrines_1709_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
