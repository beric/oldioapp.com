White" /><meta name="og:description" content="An approachable explanation of the main parables used by Jesus Christ to teach His disciples how to live. Notably, this discussion highlights how the spiritual truths of Jesus' teaching were illustrated by everyday occurrences which would have been familiar to his hearers, such as sowing and harvesting grain, making bread, and searching for a lost coin. Included in this collection are explanations of The Parable of the Sower, The Pearl of Great Price, the Shrewd Manager, the Parable of the Talents, Lazarus and the Rich Man and others, followed by a general discussion of Christ's teachings on Prayer and the Love of God.

Ellen G. White was a founder of the Seventh Day Adventist church and has been named one of the 100 most significant Americans of all time, as well as one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion. This is her second major book, following on from "Steps to Christ" published three years earlier.
