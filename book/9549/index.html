In the process, he dissects his own motives with a kind of ruthless, surgical precision through which occasionally we see the human soul of a man in agony, who might not really want to be what he has become and who grieves over the loss of his own capacity for love and compassion.  - Summary by Expatriate"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/26/items/heroofourtime_1501_librivox/Hero_1501.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Hero of Our Time (Version 2)</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/26/items/heroofourtime_1501_librivox/Hero_1501.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#1b1a20;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/heroofourtime_1501_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
