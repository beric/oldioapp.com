In addition to his publishing and editorial work, Morris was popular as a poet and songwriter; especially well-known was his poem-turned-song "Woodman, Spare that Tree!"[10] His songs in particular were popular enough that Graham's Magazine in Philadelphia promised Morris $50, sight unseen, for any work he wanted to publish in the periodical. "Woodman, Spare that Tree!" was first published in the January 17, 1837, issue of the Mirror under the title "The Oak" and was that year set to music by Henry Russell before being reprinted under its more common title in 1853.  - Summary by Wikipedia"><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/35/items/woodman_spare_that_tree_1704.poem_librivox/woodman_1704_itemimage.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Woodman, Spare that Tree!</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/35/items/woodman_spare_that_tree_1704.poem_librivox/woodman_1704_itemimage.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#e7e2de;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/woodman_spare_that_tree_1704.poem_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
