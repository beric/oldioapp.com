Anthony Trollope, best known as a novelist, admired Cicero greatly and wrote this biography late in life in order to argue his virtues against authors who had granted him literary greatness but questioned his strength as a politician and as a man. He takes a personal approach, affording us an insight into his own mind and times as well as those of his subject.Volume I covers the period (up to the year 57BC) of Cicero’s education, his rise through the courts and offices of state to the Consulship, and his exile.Please note that footnotes - predominantly bibliographical citations and Latin quotations - are omitted unless explicitly referred to in the main text; the appendices, which consist mainly of more substantial extracts from other works, are likewise omitted. (Summary by Philippa)Volume II can be found here."><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/7/items/life_cicero_0809_librivox/Life_Cicero_VolI_1201.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Life of Cicero, Vol. I</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/7/items/life_cicero_0809_librivox/Life_Cicero_VolI_1201.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#7d241e;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/life_cicero_0809_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
