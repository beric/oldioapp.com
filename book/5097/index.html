This was the Weekly Poetry project for January 9th, 2011.<br><br>William Morris  was an English textile designer, artist, writer, and socialist associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life.<br><br>Today, Morris's poetry is little-read. His fantasy romances languished out of print for decades until their rediscovery amid the great fantasy revival of the late 1960s following the phenomenal success of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. But his textile and wallpaper designs remain a staple of the Arts and Crafts Revival of the turn of the 21st century, and the reproduction of Morris designs as fabric, wrapping paper, and craft kits of all sorts is testament to the enduring appeal of his work. The William Morris Societies in Britain, the US, and Canada are active in preserving Morris's work and ideas.<p> "><meta property="og:image" content="https://archive.org/2/items/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/Echoes_Loves_House_1209.jpg" /></head><body><div style="text-align:center;"><h1>Echoes of Love’s House</h1 style="margin-top: 0px;"><div class="coverart"><img src="https://archive.org/2/items/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox/Echoes_Loves_House_1209.jpg" width=300 height=300 style="background-color:#deb9a9;"></div><iframe src="https://archive.org/embed/echoesloves_house_1101_librivox" width="500" height="30" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1352152495&ct=site-appstore"><img src="/appstore.svg" width=150></a></p><p style="margin:40px;"><a href="mailto:hello@oldioapp.com">Contact</a></p></div></body></html>
